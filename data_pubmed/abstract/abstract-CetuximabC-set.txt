BACKGROUND: Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal 
squamous cell carcinoma have high survival when treated with radiotherapy plus 
cisplatin. Whether replacement of cisplatin with cetuximab-an antibody against 
the epidermal growth factor receptor-can preserve high survival and reduce 
treatment toxicity is unknown. We investigated whether cetuximab would maintain 
a high proportion of patient survival and reduce acute and late toxicity.
METHODS: RTOG 1016 was a randomised, multicentre, non-inferiority trial at 182 
health-care centres in the USA and Canada. Eligibility criteria included 
histologically confirmed HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma; American Joint 
Committee on Cancer 7th edition clinical categories T1-T2, N2a-N3 M0 or T3-T4, 
N0-N3 M0; Zubrod performance status 0 or 1; age at least 18 years; and adequate 
bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to 
receive either radiotherapy plus cetuximab or radiotherapy plus cisplatin. 
Randomisation was balanced by using randomly permuted blocks, and patients were 
stratified by T category (T1-T2 vs T3-T4), N category (N0-N2a vs N2b-N3), Zubrod 
performance status (0 vs 1), and tobacco smoking history (≤10 pack-years vs >10 
pack-years). Patients were assigned to receive either intravenous cetuximab at a 
loading dose of 400 mg/m2 5-7 days before radiotherapy initiation, followed by 
cetuximab 250 mg/m2 weekly for seven doses (total 2150 mg/m2), or cisplatin 100 
mg/m2 on days 1 and 22 of radiotherapy (total 200 mg/m2). All patients received 
accelerated intensity-modulated radiotherapy delivered at 70 Gy in 35 fractions 
over 6 weeks at six fractions per week (with two fractions given on one day, at 
least 6 h apart). The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as time 
from randomisation to death from any cause, with non-inferiority margin 1·45. 
Primary analysis was based on the modified intention-to-treat approach, whereby 
all patients meeting eligibility criteria are included. This study is registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01302834.
FINDINGS: Between June 9, 2011, and July 31, 2014, 987 patients were enrolled, 
of whom 849 were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy plus cetuximab 
(n=425) or radiotherapy plus cisplatin (n=424). 399 patients assigned to receive 
cetuximab and 406 patients assigned to receive cisplatin were subsequently 
eligible. After median follow-up duration of 4·5 years, radiotherapy plus 
cetuximab did not meet the non-inferiority criteria for overall survival (hazard 
ratio [HR] 1·45, one-sided 95% upper CI 1·94; p=0·5056 for non-inferiority; 
one-sided log-rank p=0·0163). Estimated 5-year overall survival was 77·9% (95% 
CI 73·4-82·5) in the cetuximab group versus 84·6% (80·6-88·6) in the cisplatin 
group. Progression-free survival was significantly lower in the cetuximab group 
compared with the cisplatin group (HR 1·72, 95% CI 1·29-2·29; p=0·0002; 5-year 
progression-free survival 67·3%, 95% CI 62·4-72·2 vs 78·4%, 73·8-83·0), and 
locoregional failure was significantly higher in the cetuximab group compared 
with the cisplatin group (HR 2·05, 95% CI 1·35-3·10; 5-year proportions 17·3%, 
95% CI 13·7-21·4 vs 9·9%, 6·9-13·6). Proportions of acute moderate to severe 
toxicity (77·4%, 95% CI 73·0-81·5 vs 81·7%, 77·5-85·3; p=0·1586) and late 
moderate to severe toxicity (16·5%, 95% CI 12·9-20·7 vs 20·4%, 16·4-24·8; 
p=0·1904) were similar between the cetuximab and cisplatin groups.
INTERPRETATION: For patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma, 
radiotherapy plus cetuximab showed inferior overall survival and 
progression-free survival compared with radiotherapy plus cisplatin. 
Radiotherapy plus cisplatin is the standard of care for eligible patients with 
HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma.

Cetuximab, the IgG1 subclass chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody biologic 
that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is used worldwide for 
the treatment of EGFR-positive unresectable progressive/recurrent colorectal 
cancer and head and neck cancer. Research has shown that the principal cause of 
cetuximab-induced anaphylaxis is anti-oligosaccharide IgE antibodies specific 
for galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-Gal) oligosaccharide present on the 
mouse-derived Fab portion of the cetuximab heavy chain. Furthermore, it has been 
revealed that patients who are allergic to cetuximab also develop an allergic 
reaction to mammalian meat containing the same α-Gal oligosaccharide owing to 
cross-reactivity, and the presumed cause of sensitization is tick bites: 
Amblyomma in the United States, Ixodes in Australia and Europe, and 
Haemaphysalis in Japan. The α-Gal-specific IgE test (bovine 
thyroglobulin-conjugated ImmunoCAP) or CD63-expression-based basophil activation 
test may be useful to identify patients with IgE to α-Gal in order to predict 
risk for cetuximab-induced anaphylactic shock. Investigations of 
cetuximab-related anaphylaxis have revealed three novel findings that improve 
our understanding of immediate-type allergy: 1) oligosaccharide can serve as the 
main IgE epitope of anaphylaxis; 2) because of the oligosaccharide epitope, a 
wide range of cross-reactivity with mammalian meats containing α-Gal similar to 
cetuximab occurs; and 3) tick bites are a crucial factor of sensitization to the 
oligosaccharide. Nonetheless, taking a medical history of tick bites and beef 
allergy may be insufficient to prevent cetuximab-induced anaphylaxis, and 
therefore blood testing with an α-Gal-specific IgE test, with high sensitivity 
and specificity, is necessary to detect sensitization to α-Gal.

Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-dependent signaling plays a crucial role 
in epithelial cancer biology, and dictated the development of several targeting 
agents. The mouse-human chimeric antibody Cetuximab was among the first to be 
developed. After about two decades of clinical research it has gained a 
significant place in the management of advanced colorectal and head and neck 
cancers, whereas its development in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not 
led to a place in routine clinical practice, because of marginal clinical 
benefit despite statistically significant Phase III trials. Recent data from 
ongoing trials suggest that more careful selection based on molecular markers 
may identify good responders. Areas covered: In this article, the authors review 
the literature concerning basic science studies identifying EGFR as a 
therapeutic target, pharmacological development of Cetuximab, its 
pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, and clinical trials on Cetuximab in 
NSCLC, focusing on recent findings on putative predictive biomarkers. Expert 
opinion: Cetuximab currently has no role in NSCLC treatment outside of research 
settings. We argue that failure to identify a predictive biomarker early on has 
hampered its chances to enter routine practice. Although recent research 
suggests benefit in highly selected patient subsets, its potential impact is 
severely dampened by lack of regulatory body approval and the emergence of 
competitors for the same niches.

De novo and acquired resistance, which are largely attributed to genetic 
alterations, are barriers to effective anti-epidermal-growth-factor-receptor 
(EGFR) therapy. To generate cetuximab-resistant cells, we exposed 
cetuximab-sensitive colorectal cancer cells to cetuximab in three-dimensional 
culture. Using whole-exome sequencing and transcriptional profiling, we found 
that the long non-coding RNA MIR100HG and two embedded microRNAs, miR-100 and 
miR-125b, were overexpressed in the absence of known genetic events linked to 
cetuximab resistance. MIR100HG, miR-100 and miR-125b overexpression was also 
observed in cetuximab-resistant colorectal cancer and head and neck squamous 
cell cancer cell lines and in tumors from colorectal cancer patients that 
progressed on cetuximab. miR-100 and miR-125b coordinately repressed five 
Wnt/β-catenin negative regulators, resulting in increased Wnt signaling, and Wnt 
inhibition in cetuximab-resistant cells restored cetuximab responsiveness. Our 
results describe a double-negative feedback loop between MIR100HG and the 
transcription factor GATA6, whereby GATA6 represses MIR100HG, but this 
repression is relieved by miR-125b targeting of GATA6. These findings identify a 
clinically actionable, epigenetic cause of cetuximab resistance.

BACKGROUND: There are few effective treatment options for patients with 
recurrent or metastatic head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma. Pembrolizumab 
showed antitumour activity and manageable toxicity in early-phase trials. We 
aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab versus 
standard-of-care therapy for the treatment of head-and-neck squamous cell 
carcinoma.
METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study at 97 medical centres in 
20 countries. Patients with head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma that 
progressed during or after platinum-containing treatment for recurrent or 
metastatic disease (or both), or whose disease recurred or progressed within 3-6 
months of previous multimodal therapy containing platinum for locally advanced 
disease, were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of four per stratum with an 
interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system to receive 
pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks intravenously or investigator's choice of 
standard doses of methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab intravenously 
(standard-of-care group). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the 
intention-to-treat population. Safety was analysed in the as-treated population. 
This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02252042, and is no 
longer enrolling patients.
FINDINGS: Between Dec 24, 2014, and May 13, 2016, 247 patients were randomly 
allocated to pembrolizumab and 248 were randomly allocated to standard of care. 
As of May 15, 2017, 181 (73%) of 247 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 207 
(83%) of 248 patients in the standard-of-care group had died. Median overall 
survival in the intention-to-treat population was 8·4 months (95% CI 6·4-9·4) 
with pembrolizumab and 6·9 months (5·9-8·0) with standard of care (hazard ratio 
0·80, 0·65-0·98; nominal p=0·0161). Fewer patients treated with pembrolizumab 
than with standard of care had grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events 
(33 [13%] of 246 vs 85 [36%] of 234). The most common treatment-related adverse 
event was hypothyroidism with pembrolizumab (in 33 [13%] patients) and fatigue 
with standard of care (in 43 [18%]). Treatment-related death occurred in four 
patients treated with pembrolizumab (unspecified cause, large intestine 
perforation, malignant neoplasm progression, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and 
two patients treated with standard of care (malignant neoplasm progression and 
pneumonia).
INTERPRETATION: The clinically meaningful prolongation of overall survival and 
favourable safety profile of pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent or 
metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma support the further evaluation 
of pembrolizumab as a monotherapy and as part of combination therapy in earlier 
stages of disease.

Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer, representing 13% of all 
diagnosed cancers. Cetuximab is a recombinant chimeric monoclonal IgG1 antibody 
and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor. Cetuximab is approved for 
the first-line treatment in combination with chemotherapy or as a single agent 
in patients who have failed or are intolerant to chemotherapy in patients with 
EGFR-expressing, RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer. Cetuximab efficacy 
emerged from studies that were conducted to approve the drug. Cetuximab is well 
tolerated; its toxicities are caused by its mechanism of action and the most 
common adverse reaction is skin toxicity. The main purpose of this manuscript is 
to present an update on the evidence-based summary of efficacy and safety and on 
the cost-effectiveness of cetuximab. Furthermore, it suggests a management of 
adverse drug reactions to improve the tolerability of the drug.

Targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) either alone or in 
combination with chemotherapy is effective for patients with RAS wild type 
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, only a small percentage of mCRC 
patients are sensitive to anti-EGFR therapy and even the best cases finally 
become refractory to this therapy. It has become apparent that the RAS mutations 
correlate with resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. However, these resistance 
mechanisms only account for nearly 35% to 50% of nonresponsive patients, 
suggesting that there might be additional mechanisms. In fact, several novel 
pathways leading to escape from anti-EGFR therapy have been reported in recent 
years. In this review, we provide an overview of known and novel mechanisms that 
contribute to both primary and acquired anti-EGFR therapy resistance, and enlist 
possible treatment strategies to overcome or reverse this resistance.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal 
cancer, a disease affecting younger patients, is rapidly increasing. Cetuximab, 
an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, has been proposed for treatment 
de-escalation in this setting to reduce the toxicity of standard cisplatin 
treatment, but no randomised evidence exists for the efficacy of this strategy.
METHODS: We did an open-label randomised controlled phase 3 trial at 32 head and 
neck treatment centres in Ireland, the Netherlands, and the UK, in patients aged 
18 years or older with HPV-positive low-risk oropharyngeal cancer (non-smokers 
or lifetime smokers with a smoking history of <10 pack-years). Eligible patients 
were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive, in addition to radiotherapy (70 Gy in 
35 fractions), either intravenous cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on days 1, 22, and 43 of 
radiotherapy) or intravenous cetuximab (400 mg/m2 loading dose followed by seven 
weekly infusions of 250 mg/m2). The primary outcome was overall severe (grade 
3-5) toxicity events at 24 months from the end of treatment. The primary outcome 
was assessed by intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. This trial is 
registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN33522080.
FINDINGS: Between Nov 12, 2012, and Oct 1, 2016, 334 patients were recruited 
(166 in the cisplatin group and 168 in the cetuximab group). Overall (acute and 
late) severe (grade 3-5) toxicity did not differ significantly between treatment 
groups at 24 months (mean number of events per patient 4·8 [95% CI 4·2-5·4] with 
cisplatin vs 4·8 [4·2-5·4] with cetuximab; p=0·98). At 24 months, overall 
all-grade toxicity did not differ significantly either (mean number of events 
per patient 29·2 [95% CI 27·3-31·0] with cisplatin vs 30·1 [28·3-31·9] with 
cetuximab; p=0·49). However, there was a significant difference between 
cisplatin and cetuximab in 2-year overall survival (97·5% vs 89·4%, hazard ratio 
5·0 [95% CI 1·7-14·7]; p=0·001) and 2-year recurrence (6·0% vs 16·1%, 3·4 
[1·6-7·2]; p=0·0007).
INTERPRETATION: Compared with the standard cisplatin regimen, cetuximab showed 
no benefit in terms of reduced toxicity, but instead showed significant 
detriment in terms of tumour control. Cisplatin and radiotherapy should be used 
as the standard of care for HPV-positive low-risk patients who are able to 
tolerate cisplatin.

PURPOSE: Cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy is a standard-of-care 
first-line treatment regimen for patients with RAS wild-type (wt) metastatic 
colorectal cancer (mCRC); however, the efficacy of cetuximab plus leucovorin, 
fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) has never before been proven in a 
controlled and randomized phase III trial. To our knowledge, the TAILOR trial ( 
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01228734) is the first randomized, 
multicenter, phase III study of the addition of cetuximab to first-line FOLFOX 
prospectively choosing a RAS wt population and thus providing confirmative data 
for the efficacy and safety of cetuximab plus FOLFOX versus FOLFOX alone.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: TAILOR is an open-label, randomized (1:1), multicenter, 
phase III trial in patients from China comparing FOLFOX-4 with or without 
cetuximab in RAS wt (KRAS/NRAS, exons 2 to 4) mCRC. The primary end point of 
TAILOR was progression-free survival time; secondary end points included overall 
survival time, overall response rate, and safety and tolerability.
RESULTS: In the modified intent-to-treat population of 393 patients with RAS wt 
mCRC, adding cetuximab to FOLFOX-4 significantly improved the primary end point 
of progression-free survival time compared with FOLFOX-4 alone (hazard ratio, 
0.69; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.89; P = .004; median, 9.2 v 7.4 months, respectively), 
as well as the secondary end points of overall survival time (current assessment 
after 300 events: hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.96; P = .02; median, 
20.7 v 17.8 months, respectively) and overall response rate (odds ratio, 2.41; 
95% CI, 1.61 to 3.61; P < .001; 61.1% v 39.5%, respectively). Treatment was well 
tolerated, and there were no new or unexpected safety findings.
CONCLUSION: The TAILOR study met all of its objectives and relevant clinical end 
points, confirming cetuximab in combination with FOLFOX as an effective 
standard-of-care first-line treatment regimen for patients with RAS wt mCRC.

BRAF V600E mutations are associated with 8-10% of metastatic colorectal cancers 
(mCRC) and carry a poor prognosis with limited therapeutic options. In contrast 
to metastatic melanoma, BRAF inhibition alone or in combination with 
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors has shown little 
utility in the treatment of BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC. This is secondary to 
upstream activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway and 
other escape mechanisms. Combining RAF and MEK inhibitors with inhibition of the 
EGFR pathway through an anti-EGFR receptor antibody (cetuximab) led to the 
BEACON clinical trial (binimetinib, encorafenib and cetuximab). Trial patients 
had undergone at least one prior line of chemotherapy. The trial met all its 
endpoints and is now included in NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) 
guidelines. Herein we provide updates in treatment options for patients with 
BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC, focusing on the practice-changing BEACON-triplet 
regimen, the first chemotherapy-free combination regimen for mCRC. This 
combination is being explored frontline in the ANCHOR clinical trial.

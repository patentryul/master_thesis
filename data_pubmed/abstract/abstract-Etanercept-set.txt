Etanercept was the first specific anticytokine therapy approved for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Its clinical efficacy and safety has 
been demonstrated by several clinical trials in early as well as established 
disease. Etanercept, along with other TNF inhibitors, have revolutionized 
management of RA and dramatically improved disease activity, function, quality 
of life and mortality for these patients. It is structurally distinct from other 
TNF inhibitors and thus has desirable profiles for immunogenicity, drug survival 
and infection rate. With the increasing number of etanercept biosimilars, there 
will likely be a resurgence of their prescription. This article reviews the 
pharmacology, efficacy and safety of the etanercept reference product, and its 
biosimilars, in the context of RA treatment.

INTRODUCTION: TNF-α is a pro-inflammatory cytokine known to a have a key role in 
the pathogenesis of chronic immune-mediated diseases. TNF-α inhibitors can be 
administered either as monotherapy or in combination with other 
anti-inflammatory or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to treat 
chronic immune-mediated diseases.
AREAS COVERED: Patients receiving TNF-α inhibitors are at high risk of 
infections. Based on our experience, in this paper, we discuss the risk of 
infections associated with the administration of TNF-α inhibitors and the 
strategies for mitigating against the development of these serious adverse 
events.
EXPERT OPINION: Infliximab more so than etanercept appears to be responsible for 
the increased risk of infections. Re-activation of latent tuberculosis (LTB) 
infection and the overall risk of opportunistic infections should be considered 
before beginning TNF-α inhibitor therapy. A careful medical history, Mantoux 
test and chest-x-ray should always be performed before prescribing TNF-α 
inhibitors. Particular attention should be paid to risk factors for Pneumocystis 
jirovecii infection. Hepatitis B and C virological follow-up should be 
considered during TNF-α inhibitor treatment. Finally, patients who are at high 
risk of herpes zoster (HZ) reactivation would benefit from a second vaccination 
in adulthood when receiving TNF-α inhibitors.

factors for Pneumocystis jirovecii infection. Hepatitis B and C virological 
follow-up should be considered during TNF-α inhibitors treatment. Finally, 
appropriate vaccinations for influenza, S. pneumoniae, and HBV should be 
administered to decrease the risk of infection, and patients who are at high 
risk of herpes zoster reactivation would benefit from a second vaccination in 
adulthood.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Etanercept was the first tumour necrosis factor inhibitor 
approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the United States (US) and 
Europe. The recent patent expiration of the etanercept originator ENBREL in 
Europe has facilitated the development of biosimilar products, creating the 
prospect of reduced treatment costs. In this article, we review the original 
trials for etanercept in RA to facilitate critical appraisal of biosimilar trial 
data.
RECENT FINDINGS: Two etanercept biosimilars are currently approved in Europe 
and/or the US, SB4 (Benepali) and GP2015 (Erelzi), having met the pre-specified 
equivalence criteria for biosimilarity. Trial data demonstrates subtle 
differences in clinical outcomes and adverse events between the biosimilars and 
the reference product (RP). The development of etanercept biosimilars may reduce 
the financial burden of treating RA, but real-world data regarding efficacy and 
safety in comparison to the RP will be vital to assess for meaningful 
differences.

Biosimilars for the treatment of psoriasis.

Spain.

Introduction: Biosimilars are biological products that are very similar to their 
originators, with no meaningful differences in terms of efficacy, safety, and 
purity. Since the patents of some of the biologics used to treat patients with 
psoriasis have expired, uptake of biosimilars provides a good opportunity to 
reduce the cost of treatment. Areas covered: In this review we summarize the 
stages in development of a biosimilar product, the main differences with the 
originator biologic, and their potential implications. We have also reviewed 
clinical trials of biosimilars approved for the treatment of psoriasis. Expert 
opinion: Because of efficacy and convenience of administration, adalimumab 
biosimilars will be used to greater extent than etanercept or infliximab to 
treat patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The pharmacokinetics, 
efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of approved biosimilars are equivalent to 
those of their reference products in clinical trials, and multiple-switch 
studies are intended to provide evidence in support of FDA-required 
interchangeability. Non-medical switching is expected to become frequent, and 
the nocebo effect will be relevant. Traceability of biologics is an essential 
requirement to gather relevant information on their long-term efficacy and 
safety, especially when multiple switches occur.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of methotrexate monotherapy relative to 
etanercept monotherapy and the value of combining methotrexate and etanercept 
for the treatment of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
METHODS: In this double-blind study, 851 patients with PsA were randomized to 1 
of 3 treatment arms, as follows: oral methotrexate (20 mg) plus subcutaneous 
placebo given weekly (n = 284), subcutaneous etanercept (50 mg) plus oral 
placebo given weekly (n = 284), or subcutaneous etanercept (50 mg) plus oral 
methotrexate (20 mg) given weekly (combination therapy; n = 283). The American 
College of Rheumatology 20% improvement (ACR20) response and Minimal Disease 
Activity (MDA) response at week 24 were the primary end point and key secondary 
end point, respectively. Other measures of inflammatory arthritis, radiographic 
progression, and nonarticular disease manifestations were also assessed.
RESULTS: Patients with PsA had a mean ± SD age of 48.4 ± 13.1 years, and the 
mean ± SD duration of PsA was 3.2 ± 6.3 years (median 0.6 years). ACR20 and MDA 
response rates at week 24 were significantly greater in patients who received 
etanercept monotherapy compared with those who received methotrexate monotherapy 
(ACR20, 60.9% versus 50.7% of patients [P = 0.029]; MDA, 35.9% versus 22.9% of 
patients [P = 0.005]), and both were significantly greater in the combination 
therapy group compared with the methotrexate monotherapy group at week 24 
(ACR20, 65.0% versus 50.7% of patients [P = 0.005]; MDA, 35.7% versus 22.9% of 
patients [P = 0.005]). Other secondary outcomes (ACR50 and ACR70 response rates, 
proportions of patients achieving a Very Low Disease Activity score, and PsA 
disease activity scores) showed between-group differences that were consistent 
with the primary and key secondary end point results. Furthermore, patients in 
both etanercept treatment arms showed less radiographic progression at week 48 
compared with patients who received methotrexate monotherapy. Outcomes were 
similar in the combination therapy and etanercept monotherapy groups, except for 
some skin end points. No new safety signals were seen.
CONCLUSION: Etanercept monotherapy and combination therapy with etanercept and 
methotrexate showed greater efficacy than methotrexate monotherapy in patients 
with PsA, according to the ACR and MDA response rates and extent of radiographic 
progression at follow-up. Overall, combining methotrexate and etanercept did not 
improve the efficacy of etanercept.

The induction of autoantibodies is common following therapy with anti-TNF-α 
agents. However, anti-TNF-α-induced lupus (ATIL) is rare. We assessed the 
clinical characteristics of three patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
who were treated with infliximab and developed distinct subsets of ATIL. Also, 
we searched for similar cases in the published literature. We describe three 
patients with ATIL. The first patient had a classical drug-induced lupus (DIL) 
presented by thrombocytopenia that resolved after infliximab discontinuation. 
The second case experienced symmetric polyarthritis of 14 joints in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA)-like distribution accompanied by lymphopenia. The third one had a 
severe serositis including ascites and pleural and pericardial effusions along 
with pancytopenia. In this patient, ATIL coexisted with anti-TNF-α-induced 
hepatitis. The second and third patients met the American College of 
Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE. Nevertheless, all three cases 
exhibited ANA and anti-dsDNA positivity, and only the second patient had 
anticardiolipin (aCL IgG) and anti-histone antibodies. The coexistence of both 
lupus-like syndrome and hepatitis following anti-TNF-α therapy in the same 
patient is very rare, and to the best of our knowledge, only four such case 
reports are mentioned in literature. Patients with mild ATIL may tolerate 
another anti-TNF-α agent without recurrence of the disease. Rheumatologists 
should be aware of the distinct clinical presentations of ATIL and its 
coexistence with other rare anti-TNF-alpha complications such as hepatitis.

Biotechnologicals are an invaluable resource in the treatment of patients with 
inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) non-responsive or intolerant to 
conventional therapies. However, they are the main driver for increase in direct 
costs and represent a significant economic burden to healthcare systems 
worldwide. Since biosimilars are similar and more affordable versions of 
previously licenced biotechnologicals, they are expected to contribute to 
healthcare system sustainability and reduce inequities in treatment access. The 
landmark approval of CT-P13 as the first infliximab biosimilar paved the way for 
new infliximab but also etanercept, adalimumab and rituximab biosimilars. In 
Europe, North America and some countries of Asia, development is strictly 
regulated and only those presenting a totality-of-evidence dossier with highly 
similar physicochemical, biological and clinical performances are endorsed by 
regulatory agencies as biosimilars. The current article addresses the importance 
of biosimilar medicines in the treatment of IRD, as well as their innovative 
development and regulatory pathways, clinical evidence of similarity and 
challenges that may undermine their widespread use and success.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with tocilizumab compared to 
those treated with the tumor necrosis factor inhibitor etanercept.
METHODS: This randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial enrolled patients 
with active seropositive RA (n = 3,080) who had an inadequate response to 
conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and who had at 
least 1 cardiovascular (CV) risk factor. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to 
receive open-label tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg/month or etanercept at 50 mg/week. All 
patients were followed up for a mean of 3.2 years. The primary end point was 
comparison of time to first occurrence of MACE. The trial was powered to exclude 
a relative hazard ratio for MACE of 1.8 or higher in the tocilizumab group 
compared to the etanercept group.
RESULTS: By week 4 of treatment, the serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were a median 
11.1%, 5.7%, and 13.6% higher, respectively, in patients receiving tocilizumab 
compared to those receiving etanercept (each P < 0.001). During follow-up, 83 
MACE occurred in the tocilizumab group compared to 78 MACE in the etanercept 
group. The estimated hazard ratio for occurrence of MACE in the tocilizumab 
group relative to the etanercept group was 1.05 (95% confidence interval 
0.77-1.43). Results were similar in sensitivity analyses and in the on-treatment 
population analysis. Adverse events occurred more frequently in the tocilizumab 
group, including serious infection and gastrointestinal perforation.
CONCLUSION: The results of this trial, which provide insights into the CV safety 
of tocilizumab as compared to etanercept, ruled out a risk for occurrence of 
MACE of 1.43 or higher in patients treated with tocilizumab. This result should 
be interpreted in the context of the clinical efficacy and non-CV safety of 
tocilizumab.

TNF-α inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy both as monotherapy and in 
combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in the 
treatment of chronic inflammatory immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 
psoriasis (Ps) and/or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and may be administered 
off-label to treat disseminated granuloma annulare, systemic lupus erythematosus 
and systemic sclerosis. There are several TNF-α inhibitors available for 
clinical use including infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol and 
etanercept. In this article, we discuss the efficacy and safety of etanercept in 
the treatment of spondyloarthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). 
Etanercept is effective in the treatment of PsA, AS, JIA and uveitis. 
Independent predictors of achieving a sustained clinical improvement or MDA in 
children with JIA include shorter disease duration, no concurrent oral 
corticosteroid use, history of chronic anterior uveitis and age <9 years. IBD 
incidence was lower in patients receiving etanercept plus MTX. Intra-articular 
administration of etanercept seems to favor a prompt target joint improvement 
without serious adverse events. Etanercept improve endothelial function reducing 
the risk of acute cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events. The most 
commonly reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis, epidermal and dermal 
conditions, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, headache and fatigue.

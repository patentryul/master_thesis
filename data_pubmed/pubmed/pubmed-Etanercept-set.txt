AB  - Etanercept was the first specific anticytokine therapy approved for the treatment of 
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Its clinical efficacy and safety has been demonstrated by 
      several clinical trials in early as well as established disease. Etanercept, along 
      with other TNF inhibitors, have revolutionized management of RA and dramatically 
      improved disease activity, function, quality of life and mortality for these 
      patients. It is structurally distinct from other TNF inhibitors and thus has 
      desirable profiles for immunogenicity, drug survival and infection rate. With the 
      increasing number of etanercept biosimilars, there will likely be a resurgence of 
      their prescription. This article reviews the pharmacology, efficacy and safety of 
      the etanercept reference product, and its biosimilars, in the context of RA 
      treatment.

AB  - Biosimilars are highly similar molecules to other biological medicines that have 
      already been authorized for use. Etanercept (ETN) was the first anti-tumor necrosis 
      factor inhibitor (TNFi) approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the 
      treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in November 1998 and in 
      February 2000 by the European Medicines Agency. Twenty years later, the first ETN 
      biosimilar has come of age. Areas covered: In this review we examined SB-4 as a 
      biosimilar candidate to ETN, focusing on the available data. Current data indicate 
      that SB-4 is a highly similar alternative to ETN in terms of safety, efficacy, 
      tolerability, and immunogenicity. SB-4 has already been approved by health 
      authorities in Europe, South Korea, Australia, and Canada, as a subcutaneous therapy 
      option for the treatment of patients with RA but also for the full spectrum approved 
      for its bio-originator ETN. Expert opinion: The current body of evidence suggests 
      that all biologic activities have been demonstrated to be equivalent between SB-4 
      and the originator, including pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic activities. In 
      some areas, and more specifically when it comes to immunogenicity, SB-4 showed lower 
      incidents. Therefore, it is fully expected to have same efficacy and safety in all 
      indications.

LID - 84
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Etanercept was the first tumour necrosis factor inhibitor 
      approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the United States (US) and Europe. 
      The recent patent expiration of the etanercept originator ENBREL in Europe has 
      facilitated the development of biosimilar products, creating the prospect of reduced 
      treatment costs. In this article, we review the original trials for etanercept in RA 
      to facilitate critical appraisal of biosimilar trial data. RECENT FINDINGS: Two 
      etanercept biosimilars are currently approved in Europe and/or the US, SB4 
      (Benepali) and GP2015 (Erelzi), having met the pre-specified equivalence criteria 
      for biosimilarity. Trial data demonstrates subtle differences in clinical outcomes 
      and adverse events between the biosimilars and the reference product (RP). The 
      development of etanercept biosimilars may reduce the financial burden of treating 
      RA, but real-world data regarding efficacy and safety in comparison to the RP will 
      be vital to assess for meaningful differences.

TI  - Etanercept and Methotrexate as Monotherapy or in Combination for Psoriatic 
      Arthritis: Primary Results From a Randomized, Controlled Phase III Trial.
PG  - 1112-1124
LID - 10.1002/art.40851 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of methotrexate monotherapy relative to 
      etanercept monotherapy and the value of combining methotrexate and etanercept for 
      the treatment of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). METHODS: In this 
      double-blind study, 851 patients with PsA were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms, 
      as follows: oral methotrexate (20 mg) plus subcutaneous placebo given weekly (n = 
      284), subcutaneous etanercept (50 mg) plus oral placebo given weekly (n = 284), or 
      subcutaneous etanercept (50 mg) plus oral methotrexate (20 mg) given weekly 
      (combination therapy; n = 283). The American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement 
      (ACR20) response and Minimal Disease Activity (MDA) response at week 24 were the 
      primary end point and key secondary end point, respectively. Other measures of 
      inflammatory arthritis, radiographic progression, and nonarticular disease 
      manifestations were also assessed. RESULTS: Patients with PsA had a mean ± SD age of 
      48.4 ± 13.1 years, and the mean ± SD duration of PsA was 3.2 ± 6.3 years (median 0.6 
      years). ACR20 and MDA response rates at week 24 were significantly greater in 
      patients who received etanercept monotherapy compared with those who received 
      methotrexate monotherapy (ACR20, 60.9% versus 50.7% of patients [P = 0.029]; MDA, 
      35.9% versus 22.9% of patients [P = 0.005]), and both were significantly greater in 
      the combination therapy group compared with the methotrexate monotherapy group at 
      week 24 (ACR20, 65.0% versus 50.7% of patients [P = 0.005]; MDA, 35.7% versus 22.9% 
      of patients [P = 0.005]). Other secondary outcomes (ACR50 and ACR70 response rates, 
      proportions of patients achieving a Very Low Disease Activity score, and PsA disease 
      activity scores) showed between-group differences that were consistent with the 
      primary and key secondary end point results. Furthermore, patients in both 
      etanercept treatment arms showed less radiographic progression at week 48 compared 
      with patients who received methotrexate monotherapy. Outcomes were similar in the 
      combination therapy and etanercept monotherapy groups, except for some skin end 
      points. No new safety signals were seen. CONCLUSION: Etanercept monotherapy and 
      combination therapy with etanercept and methotrexate showed greater efficacy than 
      methotrexate monotherapy in patients with PsA, according to the ACR and MDA response 
      rates and extent of radiographic progression at follow-up. Overall, combining 
      methotrexate and etanercept did not improve the efficacy of etanercept.

LID - 10.1007/s40259-017-0246-1 [doi]
AB  - GP2015 is the second biosimilar of the reference p75 TNF receptor-Fc fusion protein 
      etanercept. It is approved for use in all indications for which reference etanercept 
      is approved, including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 
      psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial 
      spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis and paediatric plaque psoriasis. GP2015 has 
      similar physiochemical and pharmacodynamic properties to those of reference 
      etanercept, and the pharmacokinetic biosimilarity of the agents has been shown in 
      healthy volunteers. GP2015 demonstrated clinical efficacy equivalent to that of 
      reference etanercept in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis; the 
      tolerability, safety and immunogenicity profiles of the two agents were also 
      generally similar. Switching between GP2015 and reference etanercept had no impact 
      on clinical efficacy, tolerability or immunogenicity. The role of reference 
      etanercept in the management of inflammatory autoimmune conditions is well 
      established and GP2015 provides an effective biosimilar alternative for patients 
      requiring etanercept therapy.

PG  - 1173-1181
LID - 10.1080/14712598.2017.1347156 [doi]
AB  - Axial spondyloarthritis is an inflammatory rheumatic disease causing back pain, 
      functional impairment and potential ankylosis in the advanced stage. In this 
      context, TNF blockers have been a major therapeutic advance. Etanercept is a soluble 
      recombinant TNF receptor fusion protein in this vain. Areas covered: The aim of this 
      review is to summarize the current published data concerning the efficacy and 
      tolerance of etanercept in axial spondyloarthrits. The authors performed a 
      systematic review on PubMed, using 'etanercept' and 'spondyloarthritis', 'axial 
      spondyloarthritis' or 'ankylosing spondylitis' keywords. Expert opinion: Etanercept 
      showed clinical efficacy on the axial (non-radiographic and radiographic) and 
      peripheral manifestations (peripheral arthritis and enthesitis) of axial 
      spondyloarthritis (Ax-SpA). Among the extra-articular manifestations, it works on 
      psoriasis but not on inflammatory bowel disease, with a lack of efficacy data in 
      anterior uveitis. Etanercept also demonstrated an interesting tolerance profile and 
      good drug survival rates after 5 years. Etanercept was also shown to reduce MRI 
      inflammation on the spine and the sacroiliac joints. However, like other TNF 
      blockers, its impact on radiographic progression could not be fully demonstrated. In 
      the context of upcoming new biologic targeted treatments, head-to-head and 
      longer-term randomized controlled trials are now required to further define the role 
      of etanercept in spondyloarthritis treatment strategies.

TI  - Cardiovascular Safety of Tocilizumab Versus Etanercept in Rheumatoid Arthritis: A 
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 31-40
LID - 10.1002/art.41095 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in 
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with tocilizumab compared to those 
      treated with the tumor necrosis factor inhibitor etanercept. METHODS: This 
      randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial enrolled patients with active 
      seropositive RA (n = 3,080) who had an inadequate response to conventional synthetic 
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and who had at least 1 cardiovascular (CV) 
      risk factor. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive open-label tocilizumab 
      at 8 mg/kg/month or etanercept at 50 mg/week. All patients were followed up for a 
      mean of 3.2 years. The primary end point was comparison of time to first occurrence 
      of MACE. The trial was powered to exclude a relative hazard ratio for MACE of 1.8 or 
      higher in the tocilizumab group compared to the etanercept group. RESULTS: By week 4 
      of treatment, the serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were a median 11.1%, 5.7%, and 
      13.6% higher, respectively, in patients receiving tocilizumab compared to those 
      receiving etanercept (each P < 0.001). During follow-up, 83 MACE occurred in the 
      tocilizumab group compared to 78 MACE in the etanercept group. The estimated hazard 
      ratio for occurrence of MACE in the tocilizumab group relative to the etanercept 
      group was 1.05 (95% confidence interval 0.77-1.43). Results were similar in 
      sensitivity analyses and in the on-treatment population analysis. Adverse events 
      occurred more frequently in the tocilizumab group, including serious infection and 
      gastrointestinal perforation. CONCLUSION: The results of this trial, which provide 
      insights into the CV safety of tocilizumab as compared to etanercept, ruled out a 
      risk for occurrence of MACE of 1.43 or higher in patients treated with tocilizumab. 
      This result should be interpreted in the context of the clinical efficacy and non-CV 
      safety of tocilizumab.

TI  - Tildrakizumab versus placebo or etanercept for chronic plaque psoriasis (reSURFACE 1 
      and reSURFACE 2): results from two randomised controlled, phase 3 trials.
PG  - 276-288
LID - S0140-6736(17)31279-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31279-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tildrakizumab is a high-affinity, humanised, IgG1 κ antibody targeting 
      interleukin 23 p19 that represents an evolving treatment strategy in chronic plaque 
      psoriasis. Previous research suggested clinical improvement with inhibition of 
      interleukin 23 p19. We did two phase 3 trials to investigate whether tildrakizumab 
      is superior to placebo and etanercept in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. 
      METHODS: We did two three-part, parallel group, double-blind, randomised controlled 
      studies, reSURFACE 1 (at 118 sites in Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, and the USA) 
      and reSURFACE 2 (at 132 sites in Europe, Israel, and the USA). Participants aged 18 
      years or older with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis (body surface area 
      involvement ≥10%, Physician's Global Assessment [PGA] score ≥3, and Psoriasis Area 
      and Severity Index [PASI] score ≥12) were randomised (via interactive voice and web 
      response system) to tildrakizumab 200 mg, tildrakizumab 100 mg, or placebo in 
      reSURFACE 1 (2:2:1), or to tildrakizumab 200 mg, tildrakizumab 100 mg, placebo, or 
      etanercept 50 mg (2:2:1:2). Randomisation was done by region and stratified for 
      bodyweight (≤90 kg or >90 kg) and previous exposure to biologics therapy for 
      psoriasis. Investigators, participants, and study personnel were blinded to group 
      allocation and remained blinded until completion of the studies. Assigned medication 
      was identical in appearance and packaging. Tildrakizumab was administered 
      subcutaneously at weeks 0 and 4 during part 1 and at week 16 during part 2 (weeks 12 
      and 16 for participants re-randomised from placebo to tildrakizumab; etanercept was 
      given twice weekly in part 1 of reSURFACE 2 and once weekly during part 2). The 
      co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 and PGA 
      response (score of 0 or 1 with ≥2 grade score reduction from baseline) at week 12. 
      Safety was assessed in the all-participants-as-treated population, and efficacy in 
      the full-analysis set. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers 
      NCT01722331 (reSURFACE 1) and NCT01729754 (reSURFACE 2). These studies are 
      completed, but extension studies are ongoing. FINDINGS: reSURFACE 1 ran from Dec 10, 
      2012, to Oct 28, 2015. reSURFACE 2 ran from Feb 12, 2013, to Sept 28, 2015. In 
      reSURFACE 1, 772 patients were randomly assigned, 308 to tildrakizumab 200 mg, 309 
      to tildrakizumab 100 mg, and 155 to placebo. At week 12, 192 patients (62%) in the 
      200 mg group and 197 patients (64%) in the 100 mg group achieved PASI 75, compared 
      with 9 patients (6%) in the placebo group (p<0·0001 for comparisons of both 
      tildrakizumab groups vs placebo). 182 patients (59%) in the 200 mg group and 179 
      patients (58%) in the 100 mg group achieved PGA responses, compared with 11 patients 
      (7%) in the placebo group (p<0·0001 for comparisons of both tildrakizumab groups vs 
      placebo). In reSURFACE 2, 1090 patients were randomly assigned, 314 to tildrakizumab 
      200 mg, 307 to tildrakizumab 100 mg, 156 to placebo, and 313 to etanercept. At week 
      12, 206 patients (66%) in the 200 mg group, and 188 patients (61%) in the 100 mg 
      group achieved PASI 75, compared with 9 patients (6%) in the placebo group and 151 
      patients (48%) in the etanercept group (p<0·0001 for comparisons of both 
      tildrakizumab groups vs placebo; p<0·0001 for 200 mg vs etanercept and p=0·0010 for 
      100 mg vs etanercept). 186 patients (59%) in the 200 mg group, and 168 patients 
      (59%) [corrected] in the 100 mg group achieved a PGA response, compared with 7 
      patients (4%) in the placebo group and 149 patients (48%) in the etanercept group 
      (p<0·0001 for comparisons of both tildrakizumab groups vs placebo; p=0·0031 for 200 
      mg vs etanercept and p=0·0663 for 100 mg vs etanercept). Serious adverse events were 
      similar and low in all groups in both trials. One patient died in reSURFACE 2, in 
      the tildrakizumab 100 mg group; the patient had alcoholic cardiomyopathy and 
      steatohepatitis, and adjudication was unable to determine the cause of death. 
      INTERPRETATION: In two phase 3 trials, tildrakizumab 200 mg and 100 mg were 
      efficacious compared with placebo and etanercept and were well tolerated in the 
      treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. FUNDING:

AB  - TNF-α inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy both as monotherapy and in combination 
      with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in the treatment of chronic 
      inflammatory immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, 
      ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriasis (Ps) and/or psoriatic 
      arthritis (PsA) and may be administered off-label to treat disseminated granuloma 
      annulare, systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. There are several 
      TNF-α inhibitors available for clinical use including infliximab, adalimumab, 
      golimumab, certolizumab pegol and etanercept. In this article, we discuss the 
      efficacy and safety of etanercept in the treatment of spondyloarthritis and juvenile 
      idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Etanercept is effective in the treatment of PsA, AS, JIA 
      and uveitis. Independent predictors of achieving a sustained clinical improvement or 
      MDA in children with JIA include shorter disease duration, no concurrent oral 
      corticosteroid use, history of chronic anterior uveitis and age <9 years. IBD 
      incidence was lower in patients receiving etanercept plus MTX. Intra-articular 
      administration of etanercept seems to favor a prompt target joint improvement 
      without serious adverse events. Etanercept improve endothelial function reducing the 
      risk of acute cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events. The most commonly 
      reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis, epidermal and dermal conditions, upper 
      respiratory tract infection, cough, headache and fatigue.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although it is common for rheumatologists to initiate biologic agents 
      after failure of methotrexate monotherapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ample data 
      support the initial use of combinations of conventional therapies in this clinical 
      scenario. Our study explores the durability of triple therapy (methotrexate, 
      sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine) versus methotrexate-etanercept in RA. 
      METHODS: RA patients with suboptimal response to methotrexate (n = 353) were 
      randomized to either triple therapy or methotrexate-etanercept therapy in a 48-week, 
      double-blinded, noninferiority trial. Patients without clinical improvement at 24 
      weeks were switched to the alternative treatment. Of the total, 289 participated in 
      followup. We report treatment durability, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints 
      (DAS28), and other measures during an open-label extension for an additional period 
      up to 72 weeks. RESULTS: Mean ± SD duration of open-label followup was 11 ± 6 
      months. The likelihood of continuing conventional therapy at 1 year was 78% for 
      triple therapy versus 63% for methotrexate-etanercept, with most treatment changes 
      occurring at the start of followup. More patients changed from 
      methotrexate-etanercept to triple therapy than from triple therapy to 
      methotrexate-etanercept (P = 0.005). DAS28 scores and other disease activity 
      measures were not different for the 2 treatments and were stable during followup. 
      CONCLUSION: In RA patients with suboptimal methotrexate response randomized to 
      receive triple therapy or methotrexate-etanercept, the former was found to be 
      significantly more durable. Given cost differences and similar outcomes, the 
      variable durability demonstrated provides additional evidence supporting 
      conventional combinations over biologic agent combinations as the first choice after 
      methotrexate inadequate response.

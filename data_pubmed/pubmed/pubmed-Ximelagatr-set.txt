AB  - Despite the significant advances over the last 50 years with regard to anticoagulant 
      therapy, warfarin remains the definitive standard for the long-term prevention of 
      thromboembolic events in at-risk patients, except those with acute coronary 
      syndromes, in which antiplatelets are preferred. Ximelagatran, a prodrug of 
      melagatran, is an orally administered direct thrombin inhibitor whose therapeutic 
      potential has been investigated in venous thromboembolism, acute coronary syndromes 
      and prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation. Clinical studies have demonstrated 
      ximelagatran to be comparable in efficacy to the oral vitamin K antagonist warfarin 
      and low molecular weight heparin for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, 
      comparable to warfarin for stroke prevention in the setting of atrial fibrillation, 
      and, when combined with aspirin, more effective than aspirin alone at preventing 
      major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with a recent myocardial infarction. 
      Double-blind trials have also revealed the efficacy of ximelagatran in the secondary 
      prevention of venous thromboembolism and shown the agent to be as effective as 
      enoxaparin/warfarin in treating patients with acute deep vein thrombosis. Adverse 
      effects with ximelagatran include elevations in alanine transaminase (ALT), which 
      may require monitoring, and bleeding complications. Bleeding complications appear to 
      be less than or at least comparable to those occurring with standard anticoagulant 
      treatments like warfarin or low molecular weight heparin. In addition to its 
      favorable efficacy and safety profile in comparison with standard anticoagulant 
      therapy, the convenience of its oral, fixed-dose administration without the need for 
      anticoagulation monitoring might help encourage a wider use of appropriate 
      anticoagulation using ximelagatran across the population at risk, reducing the 
      incidence of thromboembolic events.

TI  - Ximelagatran (AstraZeneca).
PG  - 246-51
AB  - AstraZeneca (formerly Astra) is developing ximelagatran, an orally active thrombin 
      inhibitor and prodrug of melagatran, for the potential prevention and treatment of 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hip and knee replacement, for prevention of stroke 
      in atrialfibrillation (AF) and for post acute coronary syndrome. As of December 
      1999, the compound was undergoing phase III trials for the prevention of VTE 
      [349551]; these were ongoing in December 2001. By December 2000, ximelagatran had 
      entered phase III trials for the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation 
      [395212]. In September 2000, the company expected global NDA filing for this 
      indication to take place in the middle of 2001 [383469]; however, in December 2000 
      this was revised to the second half of 2002 [395212], and in March 2001, to the 
      second quarter of 2003 [402040], [416882], [431673]. By December 2000, a phase II 
      trial was underway of ximelagatran as a potential treatment following myocardial 
      infarction [395237]. In December 2001, early phase clinical trials were ongoing for 
      post acute coronary syndrome [431673]. By December 2001, EU and US filings for VTE 
      prevention were anticipated in the third quarter of 2002 and the second quarter of 
      2003, respectively [3144721, [350050], [431673]. Exanta is the trade name for both 
      melagatran and ximelagatran. In 1998, marketing of ximelagatran in the US was to be 
      assigned to the Astra/Merek joint marketing venture, prior to the merger [276577]. 
      In April 1999, ABN predicted sales of 4 pounds million in 2003 [328676], [394606]. 
      In December 2000, Lehman Brothers estimated peak sales to be $1.4 billion [394606]. 
      At the same time, ABN-AMRO predicted peak sales of more than $1 billion [395237]. In 
      June 2000, Deutsche Bank predicted sales of $70 million in 2002, rising to $245 
      million in 2003 [374500]. In September 2000, Merrill Lynch predicted sales of 125 
      pounds million in 2002, rising to 625 pounds million in 2004 [383742]. In February 
      2001, Merrill Lynch estimated that peak sales would reach $924 million in 2005 
      [429697].

TI  - Ximelagatran in orthopaedic surgery.
PG  - 10-7
AB  - Ximelagatran represents the first new oral anticoagulant since the introduction of 
      warfarin almost 60 years ago, and has been evaluated for the treatment and 
      prevention of a range of venous and arterial thromboembolic disorders. The 
      MElagatran THRomboprophylaxis in Orthopaedic surgery (METHRO) and EXpanded 
      PRophylaxis Evaluation Surgery Study (EXPRESS) studies have investigated the 
      efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (s.c.) melagatran followed by oral ximelagatran 
      in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing total hip 
      replacement or total knee replacement. In METHRO II, immediate 
      pre-operative-initiated s.c. melagatran followed by post-operative ximelagatran 
      dose-dependently reduced VTE, with the highest dose (melagatran 3 mg/ximelagatran 24 
      mg twice daily) associated with a significantly reduced incidence of VTE compared 
      with the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) dalteparin (15.1 vs. 28.2%; p < 
      0.0001). In METHRO III, the efficacy of s.c. melagatran 3 mg/ximelagatran 24 mg 
      twice daily initiated post-operatively (4-12 h after surgery) was comparable to that 
      of the LMWH enoxaparin initiated 12 h before surgery (total VTE incidence, 31.0 and 
      27.3%, respectively). Rates of severe bleeding were also comparable between 
      treatments (melagatran/ximelagatran = 1.4%; enoxaparin = 1.7%). Treatment with 
      melagatran/ximelagatran was significantly more effective when initiated earlier (4-8 
      h) rather than later (8-12 h) after surgery (total VTE incidence, 27.5 vs. 35.4%; p 
      = 0.0034). Based on the results of METHRO II and III, the EXPRESS study evaluated 
      the efficacy and bleeding profile of s.c. melagatran 2 mg immediately before 
      surgery, followed by s.c. melagatran 3 mg on the evening of the day of surgery and 
      then ximelagatran 24 mg twice daily. This regimen was significantly more effective 
      than enoxaparin (total VTE incidence, 20.3 vs. 26.6%; p < 0.0004). Excessive 
      bleeding (as judged by the investigator) was more frequent with 
      melagatran/ximelagatran, but rates of fatal bleeding, critical-site bleeding and 
      bleeding requiring re-operation did not differ between the groups. Taken together, 
      the METHRO and EXPRESS studies demonstrate that melagatran/ximelagatran has 
      comparable or superior efficacy to LMWHs in the prevention of VTE in orthopaedic 
      surgery patients, and that the timing and dose of melagatran is important in 
      optimizing the balance of efficacy and bleeding risk.

TI  - Ximelagatran: a new type of oral anticoagulant.
PG  - 480-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This assessment sought to evaluate the comparative benefit and adverse 
      effect profile of ximelagatran, as well as the clinical issues surrounding its 
      potential use. METHODS: We performed a Dialog OneSearch across BIOSIS Previews, 
      EMBASE, MEDLINE, PASCAL, and ToxFile to identify published literature. PubMed and 
      The Cochrane Library were also searched. Gray literature was identified by searching 
      a variety of Web sites of health technology assessment and related agencies and 
      their associated databases. The manufacturer's Canadian office, AstraZeneca, was 
      invited to submit information. RESULTS: Ximelagatran is the first oral agent from a 
      new class of anticoagulants called direct thrombin inhibitors. Other oral 
      anticoagulants require routine blood monitoring; ximelagatran does not. Ximelagatran 
      has been evaluated in the areas of venous thromboembolism management, particularly 
      after orthopedic surgery, and stroke prevention in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation. Overall, ximelagatran's efficacy appears comparable to other 
      anticoagulants in these clinical settings. Also, bleeding rates were generally 
      similar between ximelagatran and comparators but, as for warfarin, bleeding risk 
      increases with higher ximelagatran doses. In addition, there is no specific antidote 
      to help manage ximelagatran-induced bleeding. Finally, significantly more patients 
      exposed to long-term ximelagatran developed elevated liver enzymes more than three 
      times the upper normal limit, compared with patients on comparator anticoagulants. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Given its apparent simplicity of use, ximelagatran carries the 
      potential to replace, at least in part, anticoagulants currently used in the 
      management of venous thromboembolism or for preventing stroke in atrial fibrillation 
      patients. However, the safety of ximelagatran will not be fully known without 
      further evaluation and surveillance for potential liver toxicity. There is also a 
      need to evaluate its use in special populations such as patients with renal failure 
      and patients using several concurrent medications.

TI  - Ximelagatran/Melagatran: a review of its use in the prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism in orthopaedic surgery.
PG  - 649-78
AB  - Ximelagatran (Exanta), the first available oral direct thrombin inhibitor, and its 
      active form, melagatran, have been evaluated in the prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement. After oral 
      administration ximelagatran is rapidly bioconverted to melagatran. Melagatran 
      inactivates both circulating and clot-bound thrombin by binding to the thrombin 
      active site, thus, inhibiting platelet activation and/or aggregation and reducing 
      fibrinolysis time. The efficacy of subcutaneous melagatran followed by oral 
      ximelagatran has been investigated in four European trials and the efficacy of an 
      all oral ximelagatran regimen has been investigated in five US trials. In a 
      dose-ranging European study, preoperatively initiated subcutaneous melagatran 3 mg 
      twice daily followed by oral ximelagatran 24 mg twice daily was significantly more 
      effective than subcutaneous dalteparin sodium 5000IU once daily in preventing the 
      occurrence of VTE, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), 
      in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement. In one study, there were no 
      significant differences in VTE prevention between subcutaneous melagatran 3 mg 
      administered after surgery followed by ximelagatran 24 mg twice daily and enoxaparin 
      sodium (enoxaparin) 40 mg once daily. Compared with enoxaparin, significantly lower 
      rates of proximal DVT and/or PE (major VTE) and total VTE were observed when 
      melagatran was initiated preoperatively (2mg) then postoperatively (3mg) and 
      followed by ximelagatran 24 mg twice daily. In the US, four studies showed that 
      postoperatively initiated ximelagatran 24 mg twice daily was of similar efficacy to 
      enoxaparin or warfarin in the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing hip or knee 
      replacement. However, ximelagatran 36 mg twice daily was superior to warfarin 
      (target international normalised ratio of 2.5) at preventing the incidence of VTE in 
      patients undergoing total knee replacement in two studies.Ximelagatran alone or 
      after melagatran was generally well tolerated. Overall, the incidence of bleeding 
      events and transfusion rates were not markedly different from those documented for 
      comparator anticoagulants. In a post-hoc analysis of one study, transfusion rates 
      were lower in ximelagatran than enoxaparin recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Oral 
      ximelagatran alone or in conjunction with subcutaneous melagatran has shown good 
      efficacy and was generally well tolerated in the prevention of VTE in patients 
      undergoing orthopaedic surgery. Furthermore, patients receiving 
      ximelagatran/melagatran do not require anticoagulant monitoring. The drug has a low 
      potential for drug interactions and can be administered either by subcutaneous 
      injection or orally. Thus, on the basis of available evidence, 
      ximelagatran/melagatran appears poised to play an important role in the prophylaxis 
      of VTE in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery.

TI  - Ximelagatran: a new oral anticoagulant.
PG  - 397-408
AB  - Although there have been many significant advances over the last 50 years with 
      regards to anticoagulant therapy, warfarin remains the definitive standard for the 
      long-term prevention of thromboembolic events in many patients at risk for these 
      complications. Although effective, warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window, 
      necessitating frequent laboratory monitoring for anticoagulant effect. Ximelagatran 
      is an investigational anticoagulant that directly inhibits thrombin, unlike heparin 
      or warfarin, which are indirect inhibitors. Although indirect thrombin inhibitors 
      are mainly only effective at inhibiting circulating thrombin, direct thrombin 
      inhibitors are able to inhibit both free and clot-bound thrombin, thereby producing 
      more effective anticoagulation. Ximelagatran is the first orally available direct 
      thrombin inhibitor to reach phase 3 clinical trials. Ximelagatran is a prodrug for 
      the active metabolite melagatran, and has been demonstrated to have a relatively 
      wide therapeutic window in terms of bleeding and antithrombotic effect compared with 
      warfarin. Clinical studies have demonstrated ximelagatran to be comparable in 
      efficacy to warfarin and low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) for prophylaxis of 
      venous thromboembolism, comparable to warfarin for stroke prevention in the setting 
      of atrial fibrillation, and, when combined with aspirin, possible more effective 
      than aspirin alone at preventing major adverse cardiovascular events in patients 
      with a recent myocardial infarction. Adverse effects with ximelagatran primarily 
      involve bleeding complications, which are more frequent than with placebo, but 
      appear comparable to those occurring with standard anticoagulant treatment (ie, 
      warfarin and LMWH). Ximelagatran has also been demonstrated to cause transient 
      increases in liver enzymes, the significance of which will need to be addressed in 
      ongoing phase 3 studies. Should ongoing trials prove ximelagatran to have at least 
      similar therapeutic efficacy and safety as warfarin, ximelagatran may become a 
      first-line anticoagulant due to its ease of administration and lack of a need for 
      drug monitoring. The results of these trials are eagerly awaited in helping to 
      defining the place in therapy for this promising new agent.

TI  - Ximelagatran: direct thrombin inhibitor.
PG  - 49-58
AB  - Warfarin sodium is an effective oral anticoagulant drug. However, warfarin has a 
      narrow therapeutic window with significant risks of hemorrhage at therapeutic 
      concentrations. Dosing is difficult and requires frequent monitoring. New oral 
      anticoagulant agents are required to improve current anticoagulant therapy. 
      Furthermore, while warfarin is effective in venous disease, it does not provide more 
      than 60% risk reduction compared with placebo in venous thrombosis prophylaxis and 
      considerably lower risk reduction in terms of arterial thrombosis. Ximelagatran is 
      an oral pro-drug of melagatran, a synthetic small peptidomimetic with direct 
      thrombin inhibitory actions and anticoagulant activity. As an oral agent, 
      ximelagatran has a number of desirable properties including a rapid onset of action, 
      fixed dosing, stable absorption, apparent low potential for medication interactions, 
      and no requirement for monitoring of drug levels or dose adjustment. It has a short 
      plasma elimination half-life of about 4 hours in cases of unexpected hemorrhage or 
      need for reversal. Its main toxicity relates to the development of abnormal liver 
      biochemistry and/or liver dysfunction with "long-term" use of the drug. This usually 
      occurs within the first 6 months of commencing therapy, with a small percentage of 
      patients developing jaundice. The biochemical abnormality usually resolves despite 
      continuation of the drug. The cause of this toxicity remains unknown. Clinical 
      studies to date have shown that ximelagatran is noninferior to warfarin in stroke 
      prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, noninferior to standard 
      therapy as acute and extended therapy of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and superior to 
      warfarin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism post-major orthopedic surgery. 
      It has also been shown to be more effective than aspirin alone for prevention of 
      recurrent major cardiovascular events in patients with recent myocardial infarction.

TI  - Ximelagatran, the new oral anticoagulant: would warfarin survive the challenge?
PG  - 331-44
AB  - The last decade witnessed major advances in the prevention and treatment of venous 
      as well as of arterial thrombosis. Limitations of existing anticoagulants led to the 
      development of novel therapeutic approaches. Ximelagatran is a new direct thrombin 
      inhibitor (DTI) that is given orally, without the need for close monitoring. This 
      compound was tried in the treatment of active venous thromboembolism, and the 
      results were encouraging. Randomized trials suggest that ximelagatran is not 
      inferior to warfarin in the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation. Multiple controlled, prospective trials compared ximelagatran with low 
      molecular weight heparin or warfarin in prevention of venous thromboembolism in 
      patients undergoing major orthopedic procedures. The results of these clinical 
      trials are reviewed in this article. Because of certain safety concerns (increased 
      liver enzymes, potential hepatonecrosis, and increased coronary events) ximelagatran 
      has not yet been approved by the FDA. Additional studies may be required to address 
      these concerns. Ximelagatran has been approved, however, by the European regulatory 
      authorities for short-term thromboprophylaxis. The success of ximelagatran or other 
      oral antithrombin agents would provide significant proof of the concept for the 
      long-term use of oral antithrombins in the prevention and treatment of both arterial 
      and venous thrombosis.

TI  - Ximelagatran for treatment and prophylaxis of recurrent events in deep vein 
      thrombosis.
PG  - 299-307
AB  - The treatment of acute venous thromboembolism and prophylaxis of recurrent events 
      with heparin/low molecular weight heparin followed by vitamin K antagonists is 
      limited by several factors. Oral direct thrombin inhibitors (ODTIs) showed a better 
      pharmacological activity and might be an alternative in the treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism. The Thrombin Inhibition in Venous Thromboembolism (THRIVE) program 
      performed some studies developing the ODTI ximelagatran for this indication, and it 
      is presented in the overview. The aim of the THRIVE I study was the dose finding, 
      and that of the THRIVE IV study the applicability in hemodynamic stabile pulmonary 
      embolism. A prospective, randomized, double blind trial was performed to compare 
      oral ximelagatran with enoxaparin/warfarin for a 6-month treatment of acute venous 
      thrombosis (THRIVE II and V). A second double blind study compared ximelagatran with 
      placebo over 18 months after a 6-month anticoagulant therapy of acute deep vein 
      thrombosis. The efficacy and safety of treatment of patients with acute deep venous 
      thrombosis who received 2 infinity 36 mg ximelagatran was not inferior to that of 
      patients who received a conventional anticoagulant for prophylaxis of recurrent 
      events over 6 months. Ximelagatran 2 infinity 24 mg significantly reduced recurrent 
      thromboembolic events compared to placebo without increasing the risk for 
      hemorrhage. A reversible symptomless increase of alanine aminotransferase occurs in 
      6% to 9.6% of patients between months 2 and 4. The results of the follow-up studies 
      suggest that thromboembolic events may recur in patients with acute venous 
      thromboembolism after termination of treatment with both vitamin K antagonists and 
      ximelagatran.

TI  - Ximelagatran: an oral direct thrombin inhibitor.
PG  - 1881-97
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the chemistry, pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics of 
      ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI), and to review available 
      comparative clinical trial data evaluating its efficacy and safety relative to other 
      antithrombotic agents in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolism. DATA 
      SOURCES: A search of the PubMed and Cochrane databases (1995-August 2004), 
      supplemented by a manual search of article bibliographies, conference abstracts, and 
      data on file from the manufacturer, was conducted. Key search terms were 
      ximelagatran, melagatran, H376/95, and direct thrombin inhibitors. STUDY SELECTION 
      AND DATA EXTRACTION: Pertinent information from available clinical trials, including 
      study design, patient demographics, dosing regimens, anticoagulant comparators, 
      methods for evaluating effectiveness, treatment outcomes, adverse events, and 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations, was extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: 
      Ximelagatran is an orally administered DTI under development for use in the 
      treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), long-term prevention of a second VTE 
      event, stroke secondary to atrial fibrillation, prevention of VTE after orthopedic 
      procedures, and recurrent ischemic events after acute myocardial infarction. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Ximelagatran, in twice-daily doses of 24 or 36 mg, is an alternative to 
      low-molecular-weight heparins or warfarin in thromboprophylaxis following orthopedic 
      knee replacement, atrial fibrillation, or initial treatment of VTE. Improved 
      outcomes versus placebo were seen in the long-term prevention of VTE in patients who 
      completed an initial 6 months of treatment. Liver-related effects need further 
      clarification.

       "{'full_title': 'Assessment of the Role of C3(H 2 O) in the Alternative Pathway',\n",
       " 'abstract': ' In this study we investigate the hydrolysis of C3 to C3(H 2 O) and its ability to initiate activation via the alternative pathway (AP) of the complement system. The internal thioester bond within C3 is hydrolyzed by water in plasma because of its inherent lability. This results in the formation of non-proteolytically activated C3(H 2 O) which is believed have C3b-like properties and be able to form an active initial fluid phase C3 convertase together with Factor B (FB). The generation of C3(H 2 O) occurs at a low but constant rate in blood, but the formation can be greatly accelerated by the interaction with various surfaces or nucleophilic and chaotropic agents. In order to more specifically elucidate the relevance of the C3(H 2 O) for AP activation, formation was induced in solution by repeated freeze/thawing, methylamine or KCSN treatment and named C3(x) where the x can be any of the reactive nucleophilic or chaotropic agents. Isolation and characterization of C3(x) showed that it exists in several forms with varying attributes, where some have more C3b-like properties and can be cleaved by Factor I in the presence of Factor H. However, in common for all these variants is that they are less active partners in initial formation of the AP convertase compared with the corresponding activity of C3b. These observations support the idea that formation of C3(x) in the fluid phase is not a strong initiator of the AP. It is rather likely that the AP mainly acts as an amplification mechanism of complement activation that is triggered by deposition of target-bound C3b molecules generated by other means.   P-MAPA is a complex compound, derived from Aspergillus oryzae cultures, that has shown immunomodulatory properties in infection and cancer animal models. Despite promising results in these models, the mechanisms of cellular activation by P-MAPA, suggested to be Toll-like receptor- (TLR-) dependent, and its effect on human immune cells, remain unclear. Using an ex vivo model of human whole blood, the effects of P-MAPA on complement system activation, production of cytokines, and the expression of complement receptors (CD11b, C5aR, and C3aR), TLR2, TLR4, and the coreceptor CD14 were analyzed in neutrophils and monocytes. P-MAPA induced complement activation in human blood, detected by increased levels of C3a, C5a, and SC5b-9 in plasma. As a consequence, CD11b expression increased and C5aR decreased upon activation, while C3aR expression remained unchanged in leukocytes. TLR2 and TLR4 expressions were not modulated by P-MAPA treatment on neutrophils, but TLR4 expression was reduced in monocytes, while CD14 expression increased in both cell types. P-MAPA also induced the production of TNF- Î± , IL-8, and IL-12 and oxidative burst, measured by peroxynitrite levels, in human leukocytes. Complement inhibition with compstatin showed that P-MAPA-induced complement activation drives modulation of C5aR, but not of CD11b, suggesting that P-MAPA acts through both complement-dependent and complement-independent mechanisms. Compstatin also significantly reduced the peroxynitrite generation. Altogether, our results show that P-MAPA induced proinflammatory response in human leukocytes, which is partially mediated by complement activation. Our data contribute to elucidate the complement-dependent and complement-independent mechanisms of P-MAPA, which ultimately result in immune cell activation and in its immunomodulatory properties in infection and cancer animal models.   Initially underestimated as platelet dust, extracellular vesicles are continuously gaining interest in the field of inflammation. Various studies addressing inflammatory diseases have shown that microvesicles (MVs) originating from different cell types are systemic transport vehicles carrying distinct cargoes to modulate immune responses. In this study, we focused on the clinical setting of multiple trauma, which is characterized by activation and dysfunction of both, the fluid-phase and the cellular component of innate immunity. Given the sensitivity of neutrophils for the complement anaphylatoxin C5a, we hypothesized that increased C5a production induces alterations in MV shedding of neutrophils resulting in neutrophil dysfunction that fuels posttraumatic inflammation. In a mono-centered prospective clinical study with polytraumatized patients, we found significantly increased granulocyte-derived MVs containing the C5a receptor (C5aR1, CD88) on their surface. This finding was accompanied by a concomitant loss of C5aR1 on granulocytes indicative of an impaired cellular chemotactic and pro-inflammatory neutrophil functions. Furthermore, in vitro exposure of human neutrophils (from healthy volunteers) to C5a significantly increased MV shedding and C5aR1 loss on neutrophils, which could be blocked using the C5aR1 antagonist PMX53. Mechanistic analyses revealed that the interaction between C5aR1 signaling and the small GTPase Arf6 acts as a molecular switch for MV shedding. When neutrophil derived, C5a-induced MV were exposed to a complex ex vivo whole blood model significant pro-inflammatory properties (NADPH activity, ROS and MPO generation) of the MVs became evident. C5a-induced MVs activated resting neutrophils and significantly induced IL-6 secretion. These data suggest a novel role of the C5a-C5aR1 axis: C5a-induced MV shedding from neutrophils results in decreased C5aR1 surface expression on the one hand, on the other hand it leads to profound inflammatory signals which likely are both key drivers of the neutrophil dysfunction which is regularly observed in patients suffering from multiple traumatic injuries.    Background  Women experience adverse drug reactions, ADRs, nearly twice as often as men, yet the role of sex as a biological factor in the generation of ADRs is poorly understood. Most drugs currently in use were approved based on clinical trials conducted on men, so women may be overmedicated. We determined whether sex differences in drug pharmacokinetics, PKs, predict sex differences in ADRs.    Methods  Searches of the ISI Web of Science and PubMed databases were conducted with combinations of the terms: drugs, sex or gender, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, drug safety, drug dose, and adverse drug reaction, which yielded over 5000 articles with considerable overlap. We obtained information from each relevant article on significant sex differences in PK measures, predominantly area under the curve, peak/maximum concentrations, and clearance/elimination rates. ADRs were identified from every relevant article and recorded categorically as female-biased, male-biased, or not sex-biased.    Results  For most of the\\xa0FDA-approved drugs examined, elevated blood concentrations and longer elimination times were manifested by women, and these PKs were strongly linked to sex differences in ADRs. Of the 86 drugs evaluated, 76 had higher PK values in women; for 59 drugs with clinically identifiable ADRs, sex-biased PKs predicted the direction of sex-biased ADRs in 88% of cases. Ninety-six percent of drugs with female-biased PK values were associated with a higher incidence of ADRs in women than men, but only 29% of male-biased PKs predicted male-biased ADRs. Accessible PK information is available for only a small fraction of all drugs    Conclusions  Sex differences in pharmacokinetics strongly predict sex-specific ADRs for women but not men. This sex difference was not explained by sex differences in body weight. The absence of sex-stratified PK information in public records for hundreds of drugs raises the concern that sex differences in PK values are widespread and of clinical significance. The common practice of prescribing equal drug doses to women and men neglects sex differences in pharmacokinetics and dimorphisms in body weight, risks overmedication of women, and contributes to female-biased adverse drug reactions. We recommend evidence-based dose reductions for women to counteract this sex bias.    Synthesis and purification of peptide drugs for medical applications is a challenging task. The leech-derived factor hirudin is in clinical use as an alternative to heparin in anticoagulatory therapies. So far, recombinant hirudin is mainly produced in bacterial or yeast expression systems. We describe the successful development and application of an alternative protocol for the synthesis of active hirudin based on a cell-free protein synthesis approach. Three different cell lysates were compared, and the effects of two different signal peptide sequences on the synthesis of mature hirudin were determined. The combination of K562 cell lysates and the endogenous wild-type signal peptide sequence was most effective. Cell-free synthesized hirudin showed a considerably higher anti-thrombin activity compared to recombinant hirudin produced in bacterial cells.   Thrombin is a trypsin-like serine protease with multiple physiological functions. Its role in coagulation and thrombosis is well-established. Nevertheless, thrombin also plays a major role in inflammation by activating protease-activated receptors. In addition, thrombin is also involved in angiogenesis, fibrosis, and viral infections. Considering the pathogenesis of COVID-19 pandemic, thrombin inhibitors may exert multiple potential therapeutic benefits including antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activities. In this review, we describe the clinical features of COVID-19, the thrombinâs roles in various pathologies, and the potential of argatroban in COVID-19 patients. Argatroban is a synthetic, small molecule, direct, competitive, and selective inhibitor of thrombin. It is approved to parenterally prevent and/or treat heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in addition to other thrombotic conditions. Argatroban also possesses anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities and has a well-established pharmacokinetics profile. It also appears to lack a significant risk of drugâdrug interactions with therapeutics currently being evaluated for COVID-19. Thus, argatroban presents a substantial promise in treating severe cases of COVID-19; however, this promise is yet to be established in randomized, controlled clinical trials.    Purpose of Review  This review will illustrate the importance of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in the intraoperative and critical care settings.    Recent Findings  Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) occurs more frequently in surgical patients compared with medical patients due to the inflammatory release of platelet factor 4 and perioperative heparin exposure. Recognition of this disease requires a high index of suspicion. Diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies have been expanded and refined in recent years.    Summary  HIT is a condition where antibodies against the heparin/platelet factor 4 complex interact with platelet receptors to promote platelet activation, aggregation, and thrombus formation. Our review will focus on intraoperative and postoperative considerations related to HIT to help the clinician better manage this rare but often devastating hypercoagulable disease process.    Animal poisons and venoms are comprised of different classes of molecules displaying wide-ranging pharmacological activities. This review aims to provide an in-depth view of toxin-based compounds from terrestrial and marine organisms used as diagnostic tools, experimental molecules to validate postulated therapeutic targets, drug libraries, prototypes for the design of drugs, cosmeceuticals, and therapeutic agents. However, making these molecules applicable requires extensive preclinical trials, with some applications also demanding clinical trials, in order to validate their molecular target, mechanism of action, effective dose, potential adverse effects, as well as other fundamental parameters. Here we go through the pitfalls for a toxin-based potential therapeutic drug to become eligible for clinical trials and marketing. The manuscript also presents an overview of the current picture for several molecules from different animal venoms and poisons (such as those from amphibians, cone snails, hymenopterans, scorpions, sea anemones, snakes, spiders, tetraodontiformes, bats, and shrews) that have been used in clinical trials. Advances and perspectives on the therapeutic potential of molecules from other underexploited animals, such as caterpillars and ticks, are also reported. The challenges faced during the lengthy and costly preclinical and clinical studies and how to overcome these hindrances are also discussed for that drug candidates going to the bedside. It covers most of the drugs developed using toxins, the molecules that have failed and those that are currently in clinical trials. The article presents a detailed overview of toxins that have been used as therapeutic agents, including their discovery, formulation, dosage, indications, main adverse effects, and pregnancy and breastfeeding prescription warnings. Toxins in diagnosis, as well as cosmeceuticals and atypical therapies (bee venom and leech therapies) are also reported. The level of cumulative and detailed information provided in this review may help pharmacists, physicians, biotechnologists, pharmacologists, and scientists interested in toxinology, drug discovery, and development of toxin-based products.   Studying innate immunity in humans is crucial for understanding its role in the pathophysiology of systemic inflammation, particularly in the complex setting of sepsis. Therefore, we standardized a step-by-step process from the venipuncture to the transfer in a human model system, while closely monitoring the inflammatory response for up to three hours. We designed an animal-free, human whole blood sepsis model using a commercially available, simple to use, tubing system. First, we analyzed routine clinical parameters, including cell count and blood gas analysis. Second, we demonstrated that extracellular activation markers (e.g., CD11b and CD62l) as well as intracellular metabolic (intracellular pH) and functional (generation of radical oxygen species) features remained stable after incubation in the whole blood model. Third, we mimicked systemic inflammation during early sepsis by exposure of whole blood to pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Stimulation with lipopolysaccharide revealed the capability of the model system to evoke a sepsis-like inflammatory phenotype of innate immunity. In summary, the presented model serves as a convenient, economic, and reliable platform to study innate immunity in human whole blood, which may yield clinically important insights.    Patient: Female, 67-year-old    Final Diagnosis: Enoxaparin induced thrombocytopenia with life threatening thrombosis    Symptoms: Chest discomfort    Medication:â    Clinical Procedure: â    Specialty: Hematology    Objective:   Educational purpose     Background:  Heparin, often used as an anticoagulant, acts by binding to antithrombin III. Indeed, heparin binds to a variety of proteins other than antithrombin III. Among them, platelet factor 4 can bind and neutralize the anticoagulant activity of heparin. Upon binding with heparin, platelet factor 4 undergoes a conformational change and expresses immunogenic neo-epitopes that induce the generation of antibodies of the platelet factor 4 heparin complex. This immune reaction may lead to thrombocytopenia and venous, arterial, or microvascular thrombosis. However, the risk of such complications is quite variable, as it is affected not only by the source and dose of heparin and the clinical condition (e.g., cardiovascular surgery and orthopedic surgery) of the patient, but also the molecular size of the heparin formulation. Venous, arterial, and small-vessel thrombosis can lead to leg swelling, pulmonary embolism, stroke, skin necrosis, or gangrene requiring limb amputation or intestinal resection. Myocardial infarction due to coronary thrombosis also occurs, although it is less common and can be readily recognized.    Case Report:  Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a potentially life-threatening complication of heparin therapy. We report the case of a 67-year-old woman who developed ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and thrombocytopenia within 10 days of prophylactic enoxaparin therapy after undergoing bilateral total knee replacement surgery. She also had peripheral arterial and venous thrombosis. With thrombolysis and argatroban anticoagulation therapy, she recovered without residual sequelae.    Conclusions:  Thrombocytopenia with coronary and other vascular thrombosis is a potentially serious complication of heparin therapy. A trend of decreased platelet count, decreased platelet count by 30% or more, and/or occurrence of any type of thrombosis should raise the suspicion of HIT. This case demonstrates that early recognition and prompt treatment of HIT can be life-saving.     Introduction  Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a potentially lethal complication of unfractionated or low-molecular weight heparin therapy. We aimed to determine the incidence and mortality rate of patients with positive heparin/platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies, which is a rapid detection test of HIT.    Methods  Coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral and aortic valve surgeries were evaluated. Cardiopulmonary bypass was employed in all patients. The diagnosis of HIT was based on immunological assays. Postoperative complications, mortality rates, and the causes of death were specified in patients with positive heparin/PF4 antibodies.    Results  Postoperative thrombocytopenia was detected in 257 patients. Twenty of these patients undergoing open heart surgery were included in the final analysis. Antibodies against heparin/PF4 complex were positive in 20 patients. The mean body mass index was 28.8Â±2.3 kg/m 2 , mean value of left ventricular ejection fraction was 48.3Â±6.7%, cardiopulmonary bypass time was 113.0Â±35.0 min, aortic cross-clamping time was 88.0Â±32.7 min, mean intensive care unit length of stay was 10.9Â±4.9 days, mean preoperative platelet count was 307.250Â±88528 platelets/microliter, and mean postoperative platelet count was 243.050Â±89.354 platelets/microliter. The mean duration of heparin exposure was 6.9Â±2.9 days. The mortality rate was 45% (nine patients) and 1.2% (three patients) in heparin/PF4 complex positive and negative patients, respectively.    Conclusion  Although the incidence of HIT was low in patients undergoing open heart surgery, an increased rate of early mortality was observed in patients with positive heparin/PF4 antibodies.    Murine infection models are widely used to study systemic candidiasis caused by C.\\xa0albicans . Whole-blood models can help to elucidate host-pathogens interactions and have been used for several Candida species in human blood. We adapted the human whole-blood model to murine blood. Unlike human blood, murine blood was unable to reduce fungal burden and more substantial filamentation of C. albicans was observed. This coincided with less fungal association with leukocytes, especially neutrophils. The lower neutrophil number in murine blood only partially explains insufficient infection and filamentation control, as spiking with murine neutrophils had only limited effects on fungal killing. Furthermore, increased fungal survival is not mediated by enhanced filamentation, as a filament-deficient mutant was likewise not eliminated. We also observed host-dependent differences for interaction of platelets with C. albicans , showing enhanced platelet aggregation, adhesion and activation in murine blood. For human blood, opsonization was shown to decrease platelet interaction suggesting that complement factors interfere with fungus-to-platelet binding. Our results reveal substantial differences between murine and human whole-blood models infected with C. albicans and thereby demonstrate limitations in the translatability of this ex vivo model between hosts.   The complement component C5 inhibitory peptide zilucoplan is currently in phase III clinical trials for myasthenia gravis (MG). Despite being at an advanced stage of clinical development, there have been no published reports in the literature detailing its chemical synthesis. In this work, we describe an approach for the chemical synthesis of zilucoplan and validate that the synthesised compound blocks LPS-induced C5a production from human blood.

Introduction  Anticoagulants have a wide spectrum of use and risks associated with their therapy due to their narrow therapeutic range. This study aimed to evaluate the anticoagulant utilization and cost analysis in patients admitted to the cardiology ward of a tertiary care hospital in western Nepal.    Methods  A prospective cohort study was conducted in patients admitted to the cardiology ward of Manipal Teaching Hospital (MTH), Pokhara, Kaski, Nepal, from August to November 2019. All patients ( n =\\u2009132) aged â¥18 years of either gender receiving anticoagulants for any indication in the cardiology ward were included in the study. Anticoagulant utilization, the average prescribed daily dose (PDD/DDD) and the cost of anticoagulant per patient were calculated. Descriptive statistics were performed using IBM-SPSS 20.0.    Results  Acute coronary syndrome (66.67%) was a common indication, unfractionated heparin\\u2009+\\u2009enoxaparin (45.45%) and enoxaparin (27.3%) were the most frequently prescribed anticoagulants. The performance of monitoring parameters such as international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and renal function test were consistent with the American College of Chest Physician (ACCP) guidelines. The average prescribed daily dose of anticoagulants was 1.3 (unfractionated heparin), 2.25 (enoxaparin), 0.5 (warfarin), and 1.0 (dabigatran). Heparin was associated with the majority of cases of drug interactions (52 cases). Enoxaparin was the most expensive of all the anticoagulant drug classes. The median (IQR) cost of anticoagulants used per patient was US$79.92 ($46.32).    Conclusion  Our study suggests that the utilization of unfractionated heparin and enoxaparin and the cost of anticoagulants per patient were higher in the patients admitted to the cardiology ward of the hospital.    Abstract  Clopidogrel is the most common and widely used antiplatelet agent for patients with coronary artery disease following confirmation by electrocardiographic studies. The nonresponsiveness of patients to clopidogrel and the possibility of testing for clopidogrel resistance by platelet function assays (PFA) are contentious issues. Light transmission aggregometry (LTA) is considered as the gold standard test among all PFA. In this review, the most commonly used PFA used for monitoring the effect of clopidogrel, LTA, vasodilatorâstimulated phosphoprotein assay phosphorylation, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) delta and ROTEM platelet, thromboelastography, PFAâ100, VerifyNow P2Y12 assay, Multiplate analyzer, Plateletworks assay and pharmacogenetic studies, are comparatively discussed including their principles of action, advantages, and disadvantages. VerifyNow P2Y12 assay can be accepted as the ideal point of care test out of the discussed assays. However, modified assays are required which could overcome the limitations associated with currently available assays.   This review article discuss the principles of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and pharmacogenetic assays used for monitoring clopidogrel therapy and comparatively discuss their advantages and disadvantages.     Background  During atherogenesis, cholesterol precipitates into cholesterol crystals (CC) in the vessel wall, which trigger plaque inflammation by activating the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. We investigated the relationship between CC, complement and NLRP3 in patients with cardiovascular disease.    Methods  We analysed plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and carotid plaques from patients with advanced atherosclerosis applying ELISAs, multiplex cytokine assay, qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and gene profiling.    Findings  Transcripts of interleukin (IL)-1beta(Î²) and NLRP3 were increased and correlated in PBMC from patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Priming of these cells with complement factor 5a (C5a) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) before incubation with CC resulted in increased IL-1Î² protein when compared to healthy controls. As opposed to healthy controls, systemic complement was significantly increased in patients with stable angina pectoris or ACS. In carotid plaques, complement C1q and C5b-9 complex accumulated around CC-clefts, and complement receptors C5aR1, C5aR2 and C3aR1 were higher in carotid plaques compared to control arteries. Priming human carotid plaques with C5a followed by CC incubation resulted in pronounced release of IL-1Î², IL-18 and IL-1Î±. Additionally, mRNA profiling demonstrated that C5a and TNF priming followed by CC incubation upregulated plaque expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components.    Interpretation  We demonstrate that CC are important local- and systemic complement activators, and we reveal that the interaction between CC and complement could exert its effect by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome, thus promoting the progression of atherosclerosis.     Background  Patients infected with\\xa0SARS-CoV-2 often develop venous and arterial thrombosis. The high patient mortality is partly attributed to thrombotic events. An emerging trend is the presence of immunological phenomena including antiphospholipid antibodies which may promote thrombosis. The mechanism for these observations is not clear though many patients with SARS-CoV-2 develop thrombocytopenia.    Case presentation  We describe a patient with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis who presented with intermediate risk pulmonary embolism (PE). Careful attention to his daily platelet count suggested the possibility of immune mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) which was confirmed by laboratory testing and resolved when anticoagulation was switched to a direct thrombin inhibitor.    Conclusions  Since excessive platelet activation and in situ thrombosis occur in HIT, this case underscores the need to consider that thrombocytopenia in patients with SARS-CoV-2âmost of whom receive heparinoidsâmay be unrecognized HIT. A central role for the platelet in the etiology of thrombosis during the COVID-19 pandemic should be explored.    This review provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of point-of-care (POC) devices most commonly used for coagulation analyses in the acute settings. Fast and reliable assessment of hemostasis is essential for the management of trauma and other bleeding patients. Routine coagulation assays are not designed to visualize the process of clot formation, and their results are obtained only after 30â90 m due to the requirements of sample preparation and the analytical process. POC devices such as viscoelastic coagulation tests, platelet function tests, blood gas analysis and other coagulometers provide new options for the assessment of hemostasis, and are important tools for an individualized, goal-directed, and factor-based substitution therapy. We give a detailed overview of the related tests, their characteristics and clinical implications. This review emphasizes the evident advantages of the speed and predictive power of POC clot measurement in the context of a goal-directed and algorithm-based therapy to improve the patientâs outcome. Interpretation of viscoelastic tests is facilitated by a new visualization technology.   A striking feature of COVID-19 is the high frequency of thrombosis, particularly in patients who require admission to intensive care unit because of respiratory complications (pneumonia/adult respiratory distress syndrome). The spectrum of thrombotic events is wide, including in situ pulmonary thrombosis, deep-vein thrombosis and associated pulmonary embolism, as well as arterial thrombotic events (stroke, myocardial infarction, limb artery thrombosis). Unusual thrombotic events have also been reported, e.g., cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, mesenteric artery and vein thrombosis. Several hematology abnormalities have been observed in COVID-19 patients, including lymphopenia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia (usually mild), thrombocytosis, elevated prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin times (the latter abnormality often indicating lupus anticoagulant phenomenon), hyperfibrinogenemia, elevated von Willebrand factor levels, and elevated fibrin d -dimer. Many of these abnormal hematologic parametersâeven as early as the time of initial hospital admissionâindicate adverse prognosis, including greater frequency of progression to severe respiratory illness and death. Progression to overt disseminated intravascular coagulation in fatal COVID-19 has been reported in some studies, but not observed in others. We compare and contrast COVID-19 hypercoagulability, and associated increased risk of venous and arterial thrombosis, from the perspective of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), including the dilemma of providing thromboprophylaxis and treatment recommendations when available data are limited to observational studies. The frequent use of heparinâboth low-molecular-weight and unfractionatedâin preventing and treating COVID-19 thrombosis, means that vigilance for HIT occurrence is required in this patient population.   Graphical abstract    Unlabelled Image      Highlights     â¢  HIT and COVID-19 are associated with a high risk of thrombosis (venous > arterial).    â¢  HIT and COVID-19 both feature coagulation and âpancellularâ activation.    â¢  Therapeutic anticoagulation is indicated for HIT, but dosing unknown for COVID-19.

Its clinical efficacy and safety has been demonstrated by several clinical trials in early as well as established disease. Etanercept, along with other TNF inhibitors, have revolutionized management of RA and dramatically improved disease activity, function, quality of life and mortality for these patients. It is structurally distinct from other TNF inhibitors and thus has desirable profiles for immunogenicity, drug survival and infection rate. With the increasing number of etanercept biosimilars, there will likely be a resurgence of their prescription. This article reviews the pharmacology, efficacy and safety of the etanercept reference product, and its biosimilars, in the context of RA treatment.'"

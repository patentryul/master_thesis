       " 'abstract': '  Background  Argatroban or lepirudin anticoagulation therapy in patients with heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or HIT suspect is typically monitored using the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Although aPTT correlates well with plasma levels of argatroban and lepirudin in healthy volunteers, it might not be the method of choice in critically ill patients. However, in-vivo data is lacking for this patient population.  Therefore, we studied in vivo whether ROTEM or global clotting times would provide an alternative for monitoring the anticoagulant intensity effects in critically ill patients.    Methods  This study was part of the double-blind randomized trial “Argatroban versus Lepirudin in critically ill patients (ALicia)”, which compared critically ill patients treated with argatroban or lepirudin. Following institutional review board approval and written informed consent, for this sub-study blood of 35 critically ill patients was analysed. Before as well as 12, 24, 48 and 72\\xa0h after initiation of argatroban or lepirudin infusion, blood was analysed for aPTT, aPTT ratios, thrombin time (TT), INTEM CT,INTEM CT ratios, EXTEM CT, EXTEM CT ratios and maximum clot firmness (MCF) and correlated with the corresponding plasma concentrations of the direct thrombin inhibitor.    Results  To reach a target aPTT of 1.5 to 2 times baseline, median [IQR] plasma concentrations of 0.35 [0.01–1.2] μg/ml argatroban and 0.17 [0.1–0.32] μg/ml lepirudin were required. For both drugs, there was no significant correlation between aPTT and aPTT ratios and plasma concentrations. INTEM CT, INTEM CT ratios, EXTEM CT, EXTEM CT ratios, TT and TT ratios correlated significantly with plasma concentrations of both drugs. Additionally, agreement between argatroban plasma levels and EXTEM CT and EXTEM CT ratios were superior to agreement between argatroban plasma levels and aPTT in the Bland Altman analysis. MCF remained unchanged during therapy with both drugs.    Conclusion  In critically ill patients, TT and ROTEM parameters may provide better correlation to argatroban and lepirudin plasma concentrations than aPTT.

Monitoring of direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is primarily performed using the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). This assay is poorly standardized, reagent dependent, and not DTI specific. We compared aPTT, thrombin time (TT), and prothrombin time (PT) to drug levels obtained by the ecarin chromogenic assay (ECA). We analyzed 495 samples of patients with confirmed or suspected HIT on treatment with either argatroban (n = 37) or lepirudin (n = 80). Mean DTI levels ± standard deviation (SD) were 0.41 ± 0.36 µg/mL for argatroban and 0.20 ± 0.21 µg/mL for lepirudin. Results of aPTT were highly variable: 67 ± 22 seconds for argatroban and 55 ± 20 seconds for lepirudin. Significant correlations ( P < .01) were found between ECA-based DTI level and TT (argatroban, r = .820 and lepirudin, r = .830), PT (argatroban, r = −.544), and aPTT (lepirudin, r = .572). However, there was no correlation of aPTT with argatroban or PT with lepirudin concentration. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the TT predicted 54% of argatroban and 42% of lepirudin levels, but no significant impact was seen for PT or aPTT. The aPTT-guided monitoring of DTI therapy leads to a high percentage of patients with inaccurate plasma levels, hence resulting to either undertreatment or overtreatment. Knowledge of baseline values prior to DTI therapy and inclusion of clinical settings are essential for dosing DTIs when using aPTT. However, due to several limitations of aPTT, monitoring according to exact plasma concentrations as obtained by specific tests such as ECA may be more appropriate.    Introduction  Critically ill patients often require renal replacement therapy accompanied by thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia during heparin anticoagulation may be due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with need for alternative anticoagulation. Therefore, we compared argatroban and lepirudin in critically ill surgical patients.    Methods  Following institutional review board approval and written informed consent, critically ill surgical patients more than or equal to 18\\xa0years with suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, were randomly assigned to receive double-blind argatroban or lepirudin anticoagulation targeting an activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) of 1.5 to 2 times baseline. In patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy we compared the life-time of hemodialysis filters. We evaluated in all patients the incidence of bleeding and thrombembolic events.    Results  We identified 66 patients with suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, including 28 requiring renal replacement therapy. Mean filter lifetimes did not differ between groups (argatroban 32\\u2009±\\u200925\\xa0hours ( n = 12) versus lepirudin 27\\u2009±\\u200921\\xa0hours ( n = 16), mean difference 5\\xa0hours, 95% CI −13 to 23, P = 0.227). Among all 66 patients, relevant bleeding occurred in four argatroban- versus eleven lepirudin-patients (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 14.0, P = 0.040). In the argatroban-group, three thromboembolic events occurred compared to two in the lepirudin group (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.1 to 4.4, P = 0.639). The incidence of confirmed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was 23% ( n = 15) in our study population.    Conclusions  This first randomized controlled double-blind trial comparing two direct thrombin inhibitors showed comparable effectiveness for renal replacement therapy, but suggests fewer bleeds in surgical patients with argatroban anticoagulation.    Trial registration  Clinical Trials.gov NCT00798525 . Registered 25 November 2008    Electronic supplementary material  The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13054-014-0588-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.    A treatment strategy of a difficult and unusual problem is presented. We are reporting a case of a patient who had a documented allergy to heparin and required Cardiac surgery for an ASD closure. The anticoagulation regime used during cardiopulmonary bypass was lepirudin based.  This report indicates that r-hirudin provides effective anticoagulation, however unless ECT is monitoring, post operative hemorrhage is encountered. Therefore this case is unique not only because of its rarity but also by the fact that it presents the caveats encountered when ECT is not available.   Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are promising nanomaterials for biomedical applications. However, their inflammatory potential has not been fully established. Here, we used a lepirudin anti-coagulated human whole blood model to evaluate the potential of 10 nm IONPs to activate the complement system and induce cytokine production. Reactive oxygen species and cell death were also assessed. The IONPs activated complement, as measured by C3a, C5a and sC5b-9, and induced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a particle-dose dependent manner, with the strongest response at 10 µg/mL IONPs. Complement inhibitors at C3 (compstatin analog Cp40) and C5 (eculizumab) levels completely inhibited complement activation and secretion of inflammatory mediators induced by the IONPs. Additionally, blockade of complement receptors C3aR and C5aR1 significantly reduced the levels of various cytokines, indicating that the particle-induced secretion of inflammatory mediators is mainly C5a and C3a mediated. The IONPs did not induce cell death or reactive oxygen species, which further suggests that complement activation alone was responsible for most of the particle-induced cytokines. These data suggest that the lepirudin anti-coagulated human whole blood model is a valuable ex vivo system to study the inflammatory potential of IONPs. We conclude that IONPs induce complement-mediated cytokine secretion in human whole blood.   Summary  There is a close cross‐talk between complement, Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) and coagulation. The role of the central complement component 5 (C5) in physiological and pathophysiological hemostasis has not, however, been fully elucidated. This study examined the effects of C5 in normal hemostasis and in Escherichia coli ‐induced coagulation and tissue factor (TF) up‐regulation. Fresh whole blood obtained from six healthy donors and one C5‐deficient individual (C5D) was anti‐coagulated with the thrombin inhibitor lepirudin. Blood was incubated with or without E. coli in the presence of the C5 inhibitor eculizumab, a blocking anti‐CD14 monoclonal antibody (anti‐CD14) or the TLR‐4 inhibitor eritoran. C5D blood was reconstituted with purified human C5. TF mRNA was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and monocyte TF and CD11b surface expression by flow cytometry. Prothrombin fragment 1+2 (PTF1·2) in plasma and microparticles exposing TF (TF‐MP) was measured by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Coagulation kinetics were analyzed by rotational thromboelastometry and platelet function by PFA‐200. Normal blood with eculizumab as well as C5D blood with or without reconstitution with C5 displayed completely normal biochemical hemostatic patterns. In contrast, E. coli ‐induced TF mRNA and TF‐MP were significantly reduced by C5 inhibition. C5 inhibition combined with anti‐CD14 or eritoran completely inhibited the E. coli ‐induced monocyte TF, TF‐MP and plasma PTF1·2. Addition of C5a alone did not induce TF expression on monocytes. In conclusion , C5 showed no impact on physiological hemostasis, but substantially contributed to E. coli ‐induced procoagulant events, which were abolished by the combined inhibition of C5 and CD14 or TLR‐4.   The complement system and the Toll-like (TLR) co-receptor CD14 play important roles in innate immunity and sepsis. Tissue factor (TF) is a key initiating component in intravascular coagulation in sepsis, and long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) enhances the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced transcription of TF. The aim of this study was to study the mechanism by which complement and CD14 affects LPS- and Escherichia coli ( E. coli )-induced coagulation in human blood. Fresh whole blood was anti-coagulated with lepirudin, and incubated with ultra-purified LPS (100 ng/ml) or with E. coli (1 × 10 7 /ml). Inhibitors and controls included the C3 blocking peptide compstatin, an anti-CD14 F(ab′) 2 antibody and a control F(ab′) 2 . TF mRNA was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and monocyte TF surface expression by flow cytometry. TF functional activity in plasma microparticles was measured using an amidolytic assay. Prothrombin fragment F 1+2 (PTF1.2) and PTX3 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The effect of TF was examined using an anti-TF blocking antibody. E. coli increased plasma PTF1.2 and PTX3 levels markedly. This increase was reduced by 84–>99% with compstatin, 55–97% with anti-CD14 and >\\u200999% with combined inhibition ( P < 0·05 for all). The combined inhibition was significantly ( P < 0·05) more efficient than compstatin and anti-CD14 alone. The LPS- and E. coli –induced TF mRNA levels, monocyte TF surface expression and TF functional activity were reduced by >\\u200999% ( P < 0·05) with combined C3 and CD14 inhibition. LPS- and E. coli –induced PTF1.2 was reduced by 76–81% ( P < 0·05) with anti-TF antibody. LPS and E. coli activated the coagulation system by a complement- and CD14-dependent up-regulation of TF, leading subsequently to prothrombin activation.    Background  Apolipoprotein E (apoE), a component of plasma lipoproteins, increases septic mortality in a rodent model of sepsis, presumably by enhancing lipid antigen presentation to antigen-presenting cells via the LDL receptor (LDLR). Downstream, this culminates in Natural Killer T (NKT) cell activation and cytokine secretion. To determine whether apoE antagonism would protect against septic mortality in mice, apoE-LDLR binding was antagonized using heparin, which can inhibit apoE’s LDLR-binding site.    Methods  C57BL6 mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and heparin infusion. Serum partial thromboplastin time and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured at 24 hours and survival was monitored for 7 days after CLP. LDLR+/+ and −/− fibroblasts were incubated with apoE and heparin to measure apoE internalization. Hepatic NKT cells and cytokine levels were quantified via FACS.    Results  Heparin decreased CLP-induced mortality by 50% versus saline-treated controls, independent of anticoagulation. LDLR+/+ fibroblasts displayed decreased uptake of apoE when treated concurrently with heparin for 12 hours. In septic mice, hepatic ALT levels, hepatic NKT cells, and plasma cytokine levels decreased after heparin treatment.    Conclusions  Our study demonstrates that heparin protects against septic mortality independent of its anticoagulant effect. This protective effect is associated with the inhibition of apoE-LDLR binding, diminished NKT proliferation and cytokine production, and hepatic dysfunction. These findings indicate a potential clinical role for apoE-antagonism in the treatment of sepsis.    Thrombin and other coagulation enzymes have been shown to be important during atherosclerotic disease development. Study of these proteases is currently limited because of lack of robust molecular imaging agents for imaging protease activity in vivo . Activatable cell penetrating peptides (ACPPs) have been used to monitor MMP activity in tumors and, in principle, can be modified to detect other proteases. We have developed a probe that incorporates the peptide sequence DPRSFL from the proteinase activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) into an ACPP and shown that it is preferentially cleaved by purified thrombin. Active thrombin in serum cleaves DPRSFL–ACPP with >90% inhibition by lepirudin or argatroban. The DPRSFL–ACPP cleavage product accumulated in advanced atherosclerotic lesions in living mice, with 85% reduction in retention upon pre-injection of mice with hirudin. Uptake of the ACPP cleavage product was highest in plaques with histological features associated with more severe disease. Freshly resected human atheromas bathed in DPRSFL–ACPP retained 63% greater cleavage product compared to control ACPP. In conclusion, DPRSFL–ACPP can be used to study thrombin activity in coagulation and atherosclerosis with good spatial and temporal resolution. Thrombin-sensitive ACPPs may be developed into probes for early detection and intraoperative imaging of high risk atherosclerotic plaques. ',\n",

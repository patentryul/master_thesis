      "      randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial enrolled patients with active \n",
      "      seropositive RA (n = 3,080) who had an inadequate response to conventional synthetic \n",
      "      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and who had at least 1 cardiovascular (CV) \n",
      "      risk factor. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive open-label tocilizumab \n",
      "      at 8 mg/kg/month or etanercept at 50 mg/week. All patients were followed up for a \n",
      "      mean of 3.2 years. The primary end point was comparison of time to first occurrence \n",
      "      of MACE. The trial was powered to exclude a relative hazard ratio for MACE of 1.8 or \n",
      "      higher in the tocilizumab group compared to the etanercept group. RESULTS: By week 4 \n",
      "      of treatment, the serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density \n",
      "      lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were a median 11.1%, 5.7%, and \n",
      "      13.6% higher, respectively, in patients receiving tocilizumab compared to those \n",
      "      receiving etanercept (each P < 0.001). During follow-up, 83 MACE occurred in the \n",
      "      tocilizumab group compared to 78 MACE in the etanercept group. The estimated hazard \n",
      "      ratio for occurrence of MACE in the tocilizumab group relative to the etanercept \n",
      "      group was 1.05 (95% confidence interval 0.77-1.43). Results were similar in \n",

      "      occurred more frequently in the tocilizumab group, including serious infection and \n",

Etanercept (ETN) was the first anti-tumor necrosis \\n      factor inhibitor (TNFi) approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the \\n      treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in November 1998 and in \\n      February 2000 by the European Medicines Agency. Twenty years later, the first ETN \\n      biosimilar has come of age. Areas covered: In this review we examined SB-4 as a \\n      biosimilar candidate to ETN, focusing on the available data. Current data indicate \\n      that SB-4 is a highly similar alternative to ETN in terms of safety, efficacy, \\n      tolerability, and immunogenicity. SB-4 has already been approved by health \\n      authorities in Europe, South Korea, Australia, and Canada, as a subcutaneous therapy \\n      option for the treatment of patients with RA but also for the full spectrum approved \\n      for its bio-originator ETN. Expert opinion: The current body of evidence suggests \\n      that all biologic activities have been demonstrated to be equivalent between SB-4 \\n      and the originator, including pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic activities. In \\n      some areas, and more specifically when it comes to immunogenicity, SB-4 showed lower \\n      incidents. Therefore, it is fully expected to have same efficacy and safety in all \\n      indications.\\nFAU - Pelechas, Eleftherios\\nAU  - Pelechas E\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-9383-5722\\nAD  - a Rheumatology Clinic, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School , University \\n      of Ioannina , Ioannina , Greece.\\nFAU - Drosos, Alexandros A\\nAU  - Drosos AA\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-2232-0326\\nAD  - a Rheumatology Clinic, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School , University \\n      of Ioannina , Ioannina , Greece.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Review\\nDEP - 20190111\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Expert Opin Biol Ther\\nJT  - Expert opinion on biological therapy\\nJID - 101125414\\nRN  - 0 (Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals)\\nRN  - 0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)\\nRN  - OP401G7OJC (Etanercept)\\nSB  - IM\\nMH  - Adult\\nMH  - Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*drug therapy\\nMH  - Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\\nMH  - Child, Preschool\\nMH  - Drug Approval\\nMH  - Drug Evaluation\\nMH  - Etanercept/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\\nMH  - Humans\\nMH  - Infant\\nMH  - Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - *SB-4\\nOT  - *biologics\\nOT  - *biosimilar\\nOT  - *etanercept\\nOT  - *monoclonal antibody\\nEDAT- 2019/01/09 06:00\\nMHDA- 2019/06/08 06:00\\nCRDT- 2019/01/09 06:00\\nPHST- 2019/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2019/06/08 06:00 [medline]\\nPHST- 2019/01/09 06:00 [entrez]\\nAID - 10.1080/14712598.2019.1566456 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2019 Mar;19(3):173-179. doi: 10.1080/14712598.2019.1566456. \\n      Epub 2019 Jan 11.\\n\\nPMID- 30411183\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- MEDLINE\\nDCOM- 20191021\\nLR  - 20191022\\nIS  - 1534-6307 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1523-3774 (Print)\\nIS  - 1523-3774 (Linking)\\nVI  - 20\\nIP  - 12\\nDP  - 2018 Nov 9\\nTI  - Review of Biosimilar Trials and Data on Etanercept in Rheumatoid Arthritis.\\nPG  - 84\\nLID - 10.1007/s11926-018-0799-0 [doi]\\nLID - 84\\nAB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Etanercept was the first tumour necrosis factor inhibitor \\n      approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the United States (US) and Europe. \\n      The recent patent expiration of the etanercept originator ENBREL in Europe has \\n      facilitated the development of biosimilar products, creating the prospect of reduced \\n      treatment costs. In this article, we review the original trials for etanercept in RA \\n      to facilitate critical appraisal of biosimilar trial data. RECENT FINDINGS: Two \\n      etanercept biosimilars are currently approved in Europe and/or the US, SB4 \\n      (Benepali) and GP2015 (Erelzi), having met the pre-specified equivalence criteria \\n      for biosimilarity. Trial data demonstrates subtle differences in clinical outcomes \\n      and adverse events between the biosimilars and the reference product (RP). The \\n      development of etanercept biosimilars may reduce the financial burden of treating \\n      RA, but real-world data regarding efficacy and safety in comparison to the RP will \\n      be vital to assess for meaningful differences.\\nFAU - Chadwick, Laura\\nAU  - Chadwick L\\nAD  - Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool, Aintree University \\n      Hospital, Longmoor Lane, Liverpool, L9 7AL, UK.\\nFAU - Zhao, Sizheng\\nAU  - Zhao S\\nAD  - Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool, Aintree University \\n      Hospital, Longmoor Lane, Liverpool, L9 7AL, UK.\\nFAU - Mysler, Eduardo\\nAU  - Mysler E\\nAD  - Organización Medica de Investigación, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\\nFAU - Moots, Robert J\\nAU  - Moots RJ\\nAD  - Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool, Aintree University \\n      Hospital, Longmoor Lane, Liverpool, L9 7AL, UK. rjmoots@liv.ac.uk.\\nAD  - Department of Musculoskeletal Biology I, Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, \\n      Aintree University Hospital, Clinical Sciences Centre, Longmoor Lane, Liverpool, L9 \\n      7AL, UK. rjmoots@liv.ac.uk.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Review\\nDEP - 20181109\\nTA  - Curr Rheumatol Rep\\nJT  - Current rheumatology reports\\nJID - 100888970\\nRN  - 0 (Antirheumatic Agents)\\nRN  - 0 (Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals)\\nRN  - OP401G7OJC (Etanercept)\\nSB  - IM\\nMH  - Antirheumatic Agents/*therapeutic use\\nMH  - Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*drug therapy\\nMH  - Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals/*therapeutic use\\nMH  - Clinical Trials as Topic\\nMH  - Etanercept/*therapeutic use\\nMH  - Humans\\nMH  - United States\\nPMC - PMC6244902\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - *Benepali\\nOT  - *Biosimilar\\nOT  - *ENBREL\\nOT  - *Erelzi\\nOT  - *Etanercept\\nOT  - *Rheumatoid arthritis\\nCOIS- CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: EM has received research grants, funding and has been an \\n      advisor for Abbvie, BMS, Gema, Lilly, Novartis, Pfizer, Sandoz, Sanofi and Roche. \\n      RJM has received research grant funding, acted as a scientific advisor to or spoken \\n      at meetings sponsored by Abbvie, AKL, Biogen, BMS, Chugai, Eli Lilly, Genzyme, \\n      Hospira, MSD, Novartis, Pfizer, Regeneron, Roche, Sandoz, Sanofi and UCB Pharma; \\n      funding includes both bio-originator and biosimilar companies.

METHODS: In this \\n      double-blind study, 851 patients with PsA were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms, \\n      as follows: oral methotrexate (20 mg) plus subcutaneous placebo given weekly (n = \\n      284), subcutaneous etanercept (50 mg) plus oral placebo given weekly (n = 284), or \\n      subcutaneous etanercept (50 mg) plus oral methotrexate (20 mg) given weekly \\n      (combination therapy; n = 283). The American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement \\n      (ACR20) response and Minimal Disease Activity (MDA) response at week 24 were the \\n      primary end point and key secondary end point, respectively. Other measures of \\n      inflammatory arthritis, radiographic progression, and nonarticular disease \\n      manifestations were also assessed. RESULTS: Patients with PsA had a mean ± SD age of \\n      48.4 ± 13.1 years, and the mean ± SD duration of PsA was 3.2 ± 6.3 years (median 0.6 \\n      years). ACR20 and MDA response rates at week 24 were significantly greater in \\n      patients who received etanercept monotherapy compared with those who received \\n      methotrexate monotherapy (ACR20, 60.9% versus 50.7% of patients [P = 0.029]; MDA, \\n      35.9% versus 22.9% of patients [P = 0.005]), and both were significantly greater in \\n      the combination therapy group compared with the methotrexate monotherapy group at \\n      week 24 (ACR20, 65.0% versus 50.7% of patients [P = 0.005]; MDA, 35.7% versus 22.9% \\n      of patients [P = 0.005]). Other secondary outcomes (ACR50 and ACR70 response rates, \\n      proportions of patients achieving a Very Low Disease Activity score, and PsA disease \\n      activity scores) showed between-group differences that were consistent with the \\n      primary and key secondary end point results. Furthermore, patients in both \\n      etanercept treatment arms showed less radiographic progression at week 48 compared \\n      with patients who received methotrexate monotherapy. Outcomes were similar in the \\n      combination therapy and etanercept monotherapy groups, except for some skin end \\n      points. No new safety signals were seen. CONCLUSION: Etanercept monotherapy and \\n      combination therapy with etanercept and methotrexate showed greater efficacy than \\n      methotrexate monotherapy in patients with PsA, according to the ACR and MDA response \\n      rates and extent of radiographic progression at follow-up. Overall, combining \\n      methotrexate and etanercept did not improve the efficacy of etanercept.\\nCI  - © 2019 The Authors.

In this \\n      context, TNF blockers have been a major therapeutic advance. Etanercept is a soluble \\n      recombinant TNF receptor fusion protein in this vain. Areas covered: The aim of this \\n      review is to summarize the current published data concerning the efficacy and \\n      tolerance of etanercept in axial spondyloarthrits. The authors performed a \\n      systematic review on PubMed, using 'etanercept' and 'spondyloarthritis', 'axial \\n      spondyloarthritis' or 'ankylosing spondylitis' keywords. Expert opinion: Etanercept \\n      showed clinical efficacy on the axial (non-radiographic and radiographic) and \\n      peripheral manifestations (peripheral arthritis and enthesitis) of axial \\n      spondyloarthritis (Ax-SpA). Among the extra-articular manifestations, it works on \\n      psoriasis but not on inflammatory bowel disease, with a lack of efficacy data in \\n      anterior uveitis. Etanercept also demonstrated an interesting tolerance profile and \\n      good drug survival rates after 5\\xa0years. Etanercept was also shown to reduce MRI \\n      inflammation on the spine and the sacroiliac joints. However, like other TNF \\n      blockers, its impact on radiographic progression could not be fully demonstrated. In \\n      the context of upcoming new biologic targeted treatments, head-to-head and \\n      longer-term randomized controlled trials are now required to further define the role \\n      of etanercept in spondyloarthritis treatment strategies.\\nFAU - Guillot, Xavier\\nAU  - Guillot X\\nAD  - a Rheumatology Department , Besançon University Hospital, CHRU de Besançon , \\n      Besançon , France.\\nAD  - b PEPITE EA4267, FHU INCREASE , Bourgogne-Franche-Comté University , Besançon , \\n      France.\\nFAU - Prati, Clément\\nAU  - Prati C\\nAD  - a Rheumatology Department , Besançon University Hospital, CHRU de Besançon , \\n      Besançon , France.\\nAD  - b PEPITE EA4267, FHU INCREASE , Bourgogne-Franche-Comté University , Besançon , \\n      France.\\nFAU - Sondag, Maxime\\nAU  - Sondag M\\nAD  - a Rheumatology Department , Besançon University Hospital, CHRU de Besançon , \\n      Besançon , France.\\nFAU - Wendling, Daniel\\nAU  - Wendling D\\nAD  - a Rheumatology Department , Besançon University Hospital, CHRU de Besançon , \\n      Besançon , France.\\nAD  - c EA 4266, Bourgogne-Franche-Comté University , Besançon , France.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Review\\nPT  - Systematic Review\\nDEP - 20170706\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Expert Opin Biol Ther\\nJT  - Expert opinion on biological therapy\\nJID - 101125414\\nRN  - 0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)\\nRN  - 0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)\\nRN  - OP401G7OJC (Etanercept)\\nSB  - IM\\nMH  - Clinical Trials as Topic\\nMH  - Crohn Disease/etiology\\nMH  - Disease Progression\\nMH  - Etanercept/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\\nMH  - Humans\\nMH  - Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\\nMH  - Psoriasis/drug therapy\\nMH  - Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics/metabolism\\nMH  - Spondylarthritis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/pathology\\nMH  - Spondylitis, Ankylosing/drug therapy/pathology\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - *Axial spondyloarthritis\\nOT  - *Etanercept\\nOT  - *MRI\\nOT  - *TNF receptor\\nOT  - *efficacy\\nOT  - *outcome definition\\nOT  - *radiographic progression\\nOT  - *safety\\nEDAT- 2017/07/07 06:00\\nMHDA- 2017/12/07 06:00\\nCRDT- 2017/07/07 06:00\\nPHST- 2017/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2017/12/07 06:00 [medline]\\nPHST- 2017/07/07 06:00 [entrez]\\nAID - 10.1080/14712598.2017.1347156 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2017 Sep;17(9):1173-1181. doi: 10.1080/14712598.2017.1347156. \\n      Epub 2017 Jul 6.\\n\\nPMID- 31469238\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- MEDLINE\\nDCOM- 20200317\\nLR  - 20200317\\nIS  - 2326-5205 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2326-5191 (Linking)\\nVI  - 72\\nIP  - 1\\nDP  - 2020 Jan\\nTI  - Cardiovascular Safety of Tocilizumab Versus Etanercept in Rheumatoid Arthritis: A \\n      Randomized Controlled Trial.\\nPG  - 31-40\\nLID - 10.1002/art.41095 [doi]\\nAB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in \\n      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with tocilizumab compared to those \\n      treated with the tumor necrosis factor inhibitor etanercept. METHODS: This \\n      randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial enrolled patients with active \\n      seropositive RA (n =\\xa03,080) who had an inadequate response to conventional synthetic \\n      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and who had at least 1 cardiovascular (CV) \\n      risk factor. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive open-label tocilizumab \\n      at 8\\xa0mg/kg/month or etanercept at 50 mg/week. All patients were followed up for a \\n      mean of 3.2 years. The primary end point was comparison of time to first occurrence \\n      of MACE. The trial was powered to exclude a relative hazard ratio for MACE of 1.8 or \\n      higher in the tocilizumab group compared to the etanercept group. RESULTS: By week 4 \\n      of treatment, the serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density \\n      lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were a median 11.1%, 5.7%, and \\n      13.6% higher, respectively, in patients receiving tocilizumab compared to those \\n      receiving etanercept (each P < 0.001). During follow-up, 83 MACE occurred in the \\n      tocilizumab group compared to 78 MACE in the etanercept group. The estimated hazard \\n      ratio for occurrence of MACE in the tocilizumab group relative to the etanercept \\n      group was 1.05 (95% confidence interval 0.77-1.43). Results were similar in \\n      sensitivity analyses and in the on-treatment population analysis. Adverse events \\n      occurred more frequently in the tocilizumab group, including serious infection and \\n      gastrointestinal perforation. CONCLUSION: The results of this trial, which provide \\n      insights into the CV safety of tocilizumab as compared to etanercept, ruled out a \\n      risk for occurrence of MACE of 1.43 or higher in patients treated with tocilizumab. \\n      This result should be interpreted in the context of the clinical efficacy and non-CV \\n      safety of tocilizumab.\\nCI  - © 2019, American College of Rheumatology.\\nFAU - Giles, Jon T\\nAU  - Giles JT\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-8792-0402\\nAD  - Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York.\\nFAU - Sattar, Naveed\\nAU  - Sattar N\\nAD  - University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.\\nFAU - Gabriel, Sherine\\nAU  - Gabriel S\\nAD  - Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, New Jersey.\\nFAU - Ridker, Paul M\\nAU  - Ridker PM\\nAD  - Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.\\nFAU - Gay, Steffen\\nAU  - Gay S\\nAD  - University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.\\nFAU - Warne, Charles\\nAU  - Warne C\\nAD  - Roche Products Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, UK.\\nFAU - Musselman, David\\nAU  - Musselman D\\nAD  - Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, California.\\nFAU - Brockwell, Laura\\nAU  - Brockwell L\\nAD  - Roche Products Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, UK.\\nFAU - Shittu, Emma\\nAU  - Shittu E\\nAD  - Roche Products Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, UK.\\nFAU - Klearman, Micki\\nAU  - Klearman M\\nAD  - Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, California.\\nFAU - Fleming, Thomas R\\nAU  - Fleming TR\\nAD  - University of Washington, Seattle.\\nLA  - eng\\nSI  - ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01331837\\nPT  - Comparative Study\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Randomized Controlled Trial\\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Arthritis Rheumatol\\nJT  - Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)\\nJID - 101623795\\nRN  - 0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)\\nRN  - 0 (Antirheumatic Agents)\\nRN  - 0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors)\\nRN  - I031V2H011 (tocilizumab)\\nRN  - OP401G7OJC (Etanercept)\\nSB  - AIM\\nSB  - IM\\nCIN - Arthritis Rheumatol. 2020 Jan;72(1):4-6.

Previous research suggested clinical improvement with inhibition of \\n      interleukin 23 p19. We did two phase 3 trials to investigate whether tildrakizumab \\n      is superior to placebo and etanercept in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. \\n      METHODS: We did two three-part, parallel group, double-blind, randomised controlled \\n      studies, reSURFACE 1 (at 118 sites in Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, and the USA) \\n      and reSURFACE 2 (at 132 sites in Europe, Israel, and the USA). Participants aged 18 \\n      years or older with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis (body surface area \\n      involvement ≥10%, Physician's Global Assessment [PGA] score ≥3, and Psoriasis Area \\n      and Severity Index [PASI] score ≥12) were randomised (via interactive voice and web \\n      response system) to tildrakizumab 200 mg, tildrakizumab 100 mg, or placebo in \\n      reSURFACE 1 (2:2:1), or to tildrakizumab 200 mg, tildrakizumab 100 mg, placebo, or \\n      etanercept 50 mg (2:2:1:2). Randomisation was done by region and stratified for \\n      bodyweight (≤90 kg or >90 kg) and previous exposure to biologics therapy for \\n      psoriasis. Investigators, participants, and study personnel were blinded to group \\n      allocation and remained blinded until completion of the studies. Assigned medication \\n      was identical in appearance and packaging. Tildrakizumab was administered \\n      subcutaneously at weeks 0 and 4 during part 1 and at week 16 during part 2 (weeks 12 \\n      and 16 for participants re-randomised from placebo to tildrakizumab; etanercept was \\n      given twice weekly in part 1 of reSURFACE 2 and once weekly during part 2). The \\n      co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 and PGA \\n      response (score of 0 or 1 with ≥2 grade score reduction from baseline) at week 12. \\n      Safety was assessed in the all-participants-as-treated population, and efficacy in \\n      the full-analysis set. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers \\n      NCT01722331 (reSURFACE 1) and NCT01729754 (reSURFACE 2). These studies are \\n      completed, but extension studies are ongoing. FINDINGS: reSURFACE 1 ran from Dec 10, \\n      2012, to Oct 28, 2015. reSURFACE 2 ran from Feb 12, 2013, to Sept 28, 2015. In \\n      reSURFACE 1, 772 patients were randomly assigned, 308 to tildrakizumab 200 mg, 309 \\n      to tildrakizumab 100 mg, and 155 to placebo. At week 12, 192 patients (62%) in the \\n      200 mg group and 197 patients (64%) in the 100 mg group achieved PASI 75, compared \\n      with 9 patients (6%) in the placebo group (p<0·0001 for comparisons of both \\n      tildrakizumab groups vs placebo). 182 patients (59%) in the 200 mg group and 179 \\n      patients (58%) in the 100 mg group achieved PGA responses, compared with 11 patients \\n      (7%) in the placebo group (p<0·0001 for comparisons of both tildrakizumab groups vs \\n      placebo). In reSURFACE 2, 1090 patients were randomly assigned, 314 to tildrakizumab \\n      200 mg, 307 to tildrakizumab 100 mg, 156 to placebo, and 313 to etanercept. At week \\n      12, 206 patients (66%) in the 200 mg group, and 188 patients (61%) in the 100 mg \\n      group achieved PASI 75, compared with 9 patients (6%) in the placebo group and 151 \\n      patients (48%) in the etanercept group (p<0·0001 for comparisons of both \\n      tildrakizumab groups vs placebo; p<0·0001 for 200 mg vs etanercept and p=0·0010 for \\n      100 mg vs etanercept). 186 patients (59%) in the 200 mg group, and 168 patients \\n      (59%) [corrected] in the 100 mg group achieved a PGA response, compared with 7 \\n      patients (4%) in the placebo group and 149 patients (48%) in the etanercept group \\n      (p<0·0001 for comparisons of both tildrakizumab groups vs placebo; p=0·0031 for 200 \\n      mg vs etanercept and p=0·0663 for 100 mg vs etanercept). Serious adverse events were \\n      similar and low in all groups in both trials. One patient died in reSURFACE 2, in \\n      the tildrakizumab 100 mg group; the patient had alcoholic cardiomyopathy and \\n      steatohepatitis, and adjudication was unable to determine the cause of death. \\n      INTERPRETATION: In two phase 3 trials, tildrakizumab 200 mg and 100 mg were \\n      efficacious compared with placebo and etanercept and were well tolerated in the \\n      treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.

There are several \\n      TNF-α inhibitors available for clinical use including infliximab, adalimumab, \\n      golimumab, certolizumab pegol and etanercept. In this article, we discuss the \\n      efficacy and safety of etanercept in the treatment of spondyloarthritis and juvenile \\n      idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Etanercept is effective in the treatment of PsA, AS, JIA \\n      and uveitis. Independent predictors of achieving a sustained clinical improvement or \\n      MDA in children with JIA include shorter disease duration, no concurrent oral \\n      corticosteroid use, history of chronic anterior uveitis and age <9\\xa0years. IBD \\n      incidence was lower in patients receiving etanercept plus MTX. Intra-articular \\n      administration of etanercept seems to favor a prompt target joint improvement \\n      without serious adverse events. Etanercept improve endothelial function reducing the \\n      risk of acute cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events. The most commonly \\n      reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis, epidermal and dermal conditions, upper \\n      respiratory tract infection, cough, headache and fatigue.\\nFAU - Murdaca, Giuseppe\\nAU  - Murdaca G\\nAD  - a Department of Internal Medicine, Scleroderma Unit, Clinical Immunology Unit , \\n      University of Genova and IRCCS-Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino , \\n      Genova , Italy.\\nFAU - Negrini, Simone\\nAU  - Negrini S\\nAD  - a Department of Internal Medicine, Scleroderma Unit, Clinical Immunology Unit , \\n      University of Genova and IRCCS-Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino , \\n      Genova , Italy.\\nFAU - Magnani, Ottavia\\nAU  - Magnani O\\nAD  - a Department of Internal Medicine, Scleroderma Unit, Clinical Immunology Unit , \\n      University of Genova and IRCCS-Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino , \\n      Genova , Italy.\\nFAU - Penza, Elena\\nAU  - Penza E\\nAD  - a Department of Internal Medicine, Scleroderma Unit, Clinical Immunology Unit , \\n      University of Genova and IRCCS-Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino , \\n      Genova , Italy.\\nFAU - Pellecchio, Marco\\nAU  - Pellecchio M\\nAD  - a Department of Internal Medicine, Scleroderma Unit, Clinical Immunology Unit , \\n      University of Genova and IRCCS-Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino , \\n      Genova , Italy.\\nFAU - Gulli, Rossella\\nAU  - Gulli R\\nAD  - b Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics and Maternal \\n      Child Health, Section of Medical Genetics , University of Genova and IRCCS-Azienda \\n      Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino , Genova , Italy.\\nFAU - Mandich, Paola\\nAU  - Mandich P\\nAD  - b Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics and Maternal \\n      Child Health, Section of Medical Genetics , University of Genova and IRCCS-Azienda \\n      Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino , Genova , Italy.\\nFAU - Puppo, Francesco\\nAU  - Puppo F\\nAD  - a Department of Internal Medicine, Scleroderma Unit, Clinical Immunology Unit , \\n      University of Genova and IRCCS-Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino , \\n      Genova , Italy.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Review\\nDEP - 20170824\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Mod Rheumatol\\nJT  - Modern rheumatology\\nJID - 100959226\\nRN  - 0 (Antirheumatic Agents)\\nRN  - OP401G7OJC (Etanercept)\\nSB  - IM\\nMH  - Adolescent\\nMH  - Antirheumatic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use\\nMH  - Arthritis, Juvenile/*drug therapy\\nMH  - Child\\nMH  - Etanercept/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use\\nMH  - Humans\\nMH  - Spondylitis, Ankylosing/*drug therapy\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Etanercept\\nOT  - SAPHO syndrome\\nOT  - pharmacogenomics\\nOT  - spondyloarthritis\\nEDAT- 2017/08/25 06:00\\nMHDA- 2018/08/28 06:00\\nCRDT- 2017/08/25 06:00\\nPHST- 2017/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2018/08/28 06:00 [medline]\\nPHST- 2017/08/25 06:00 [entrez]\\nAID - 10.1080/14397595.2017.1366006 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Mod Rheumatol. 2018 May;28(3):417-431. doi: 10.1080/14397595.2017.1366006.

Our study explores the durability of triple therapy (methotrexate, \\n      sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine) versus methotrexate-etanercept in RA. \\n      METHODS: RA patients with suboptimal response to methotrexate (n\\u2009=\\u2009353) were \\n      randomized to either triple therapy or methotrexate-etanercept therapy in a 48-week, \\n      double-blinded, noninferiority trial. Patients without clinical improvement at 24 \\n      weeks were switched to the alternative treatment. Of the total, 289 participated in \\n      followup. We report treatment durability, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints \\n      (DAS28), and other measures during an open-label extension for an additional period \\n      up to 72 weeks. RESULTS: Mean\\u2009±\\u2009SD duration of open-label followup was 11\\u2009±\\u20096 \\n      months. The likelihood of continuing conventional therapy at 1 year was 78% for \\n      triple therapy versus 63% for methotrexate-etanercept, with most treatment changes \\n      occurring at the start of followup. More patients changed from \\n      methotrexate-etanercept to triple therapy than from triple therapy to \\n      methotrexate-etanercept (P\\u2009=\\u20090.005). DAS28 scores and other disease activity \\n      measures were not different for the 2 treatments and were stable during followup. \\n      CONCLUSION: In RA patients with suboptimal methotrexate response randomized to \\n      receive triple therapy or methotrexate-etanercept, the former was found to be \\n      significantly more durable. Given cost differences and similar outcomes, the \\n      variable durability demonstrated provides additional evidence supporting \\n      conventional combinations over biologic agent combinations as the first choice after \\n      methotrexate inadequate response.\\nCI  - © 2017, American College of Rheumatology.\\nFAU - Peper, Shana M\\nAU  - Peper SM\\nAD  - Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha.\\nFAU - Lew, Robert\\nAU  - Lew R\\nAD  - Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha.\\nFAU - Mikuls, Ted\\nAU  - Mikuls T\\nAD  - Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha.\\nFAU - Brophy, Mary\\nAU  - Brophy M\\nAD  - Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha.\\nFAU - Rybin, Denis\\nAU  - Rybin D\\nAD  - Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha.\\nFAU - Wu, Hongseng\\nAU  - Wu H\\nAD  - Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha.\\nFAU - O'Dell, James\\nAU  - O'Dell J\\nAD  - Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha.\\nLA  - eng\\nSI  - ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00405275\\nPT  - Comparative Study\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Multicenter Study\\nPT  - Randomized Controlled Trial\\nDEP - 20170906\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken)\\nJT  - Arthritis care & research\\nJID - 101518086\\nRN  - 0 (Antirheumatic Agents)\\nRN  - 0 (Biological Products)\\nRN  - 3XC8GUZ6CB (Sulfasalazine)\\nRN  - 4QWG6N8QKH (Hydroxychloroquine)\\nRN  - OP401G7OJC (Etanercept)\\nRN  - YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)\\nSB  - IM\\nMH  - Adult\\nMH  - Aged\\nMH  - Aged, 80 and over\\nMH  - Antirheumatic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\\nMH  - Arthritis, Rheumatoid/diagnosis/*drug therapy\\nMH  - Biological Products/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\\nMH  - Canada\\nMH  - Disability Evaluation\\nMH  - Double-Blind Method\\nMH  - Drug Substitution\\nMH  - Drug Therapy, Combination\\nMH  - Etanercept/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\\nMH  - Female\\nMH  - Humans\\nMH  - Hydroxychloroquine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\\nMH  - Male\\nMH  - Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\\nMH  - Middle Aged\\nMH  - Remission Induction\\nMH  - Sulfasalazine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\\nMH  - Time Factors\\nMH  - Treatment Outcome\\nMH  - United States\\nMH  - Young Adult\\nEDAT- 2017/04/08 06:00\\nMHDA- 2017/10/11 06:00\\nCRDT- 2017/04/08 06:00\\nPHST- 2016/10/07 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2017/02/24 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2017/04/04 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2017/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]\\nPHST- 2017/04/08 06:00 [entrez]\\nAID - 10.1002/acr.23255 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken). 2017 Oct;69(10):1467-1472. doi: 10.1002/acr.23255. \\n      Epub 2017 Sep 6.\\n\""
